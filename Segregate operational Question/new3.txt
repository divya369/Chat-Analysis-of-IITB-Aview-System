please go through it again and see proper connections
your audio right now is not coming from the mic you are holding
it is coming from a podium mic or some other mic
do you have audio mixer and amplifier
as required for this type of sessions
can you show through camera your audio mixer and amplifier
yes. we have audio mixer
ok
and amplifier also\
but the connections and microphone selection setttings are not proper
you need to do it according to the A-VIEW guidelines file
it is there on our website from where you downloaded  A-VIEW and also mailed to you as pdf
NO
See what iam saying is you are audible but from the mic which you spoke right now,
But that is not how it will work in A-VIEW sessions
your audio should come from a handheld mic which can be passed to everyone in the classroom
So how willl igt work??
The MIC from which audio is coming right now is a conference MIC from which i can hear everything in the room everyones audio all the background noise at the same time
and it also generates echo
In A-VIEW settings you have selected that conference MIC, you need to select the handheld mic then your audio will come from that mic
sir
sheere is setting option
in a view
Please Read carefully, In A-VIEW settings where you silect Microphone when you press start button and select your camera and MIcrophone
in that setting
If you follow step by step instructions given in the guidelines file your problem will be solved

use animations in the slide to make it effective
use some assignment in slides in between session disscuss on that and move to next slides
Thank You sir
I'm feeling difficult while prepare ppt for theory subjects because it is becoming like just seeing the slides and reading it..
insted of complete  sentences use points only
when you come to that point then explain it briefly
whenever possible add figure instead of theory and explai it...also add some animation to it
Thank you sir...i'll try it defenitely.. Is there any tool or software to design innovative ppts sir?
it will be first send to the other participants for peer review..after that based on points given by participants your assignments will be graded
