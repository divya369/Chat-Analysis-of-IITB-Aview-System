these are topics beyond the scope of the current evthe three but you will be intimated about this in due course of time because we are something that is something that we are trying to so once we have a community that is when the idea of working groups make more sense so your trying to build this community through this so all of your part of the working group in essence the sense that you are all working towards improving the wee hours of your off the if the participants in that way you are part of the egf dippy a working group a but yeah details of this a is currently beyond the scope of this program so let us limit to the scope of the program to discuss can more than one mentor guide one mentee yes all such innovative practices are welcome but ensure that there is only single point of annecy we introduce one mentor to the metal so it is important that when you involve another mentor also in the process you introduce them to the mentee and tell why they have been up why are they part of this mentality interaction by so too should include multiple groups only when you are having multiple groups involved then only it makes sense that one onto can learn from multiple people are so regarding submissions we will try to accommodate maximum as possible but see every program has certain a mandate under which it works so submissions under due date is very important and so if you are registered for a program submissions within the due date is paramount for you to take the best benefit out of it in terms of certificate but in terms of learning you as you know see a if you have learnt sufficient you will know it yourself certificate is only of what you say a technical document that you show some others either for career advancement or show that this is how what a ighty bombay has given me so i hope you will not work just for certification but it is also for the knowledge improvement and please maintain the due dates otherwise it will be hard for us too in in improve a include you in any of the a further additional efforts cause all these are programs done under certain mandate and we are giving you sufficient time to do the activity and even for the meantime there is sufficient time to do the activity so how to give provide betterment interaction proof i hope ive already said that you can record or you can do screen shots any of this is good enough yes so i agree that if the mentors and mentees from same domain and will try to do that but the diversity so high that we cannot assure you that you will get a mentee from the same domain how will you take attendance was i said attendance for the safety is not a mandatory thing it is completely online with office hours office hours is the blend interaction and there are no mandates a per say regarding attendance so if you want to skip an office hours your free to do that but it is in the office hours that maximum queries will get personal attention from the instructor contents will be uploaded by five pmqs today and the course will be up reflection points and if the petry see reflection
