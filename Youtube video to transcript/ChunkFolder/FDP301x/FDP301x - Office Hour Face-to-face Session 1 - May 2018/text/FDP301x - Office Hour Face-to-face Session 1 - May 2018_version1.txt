created a group of mentees arm who would or with whom you could interact and we also had seen lot of benefits of this interaction wherein a wherein we have seen that the overall performance of the participants in the fd improved drastically abby had a so the the first offering of depot where the top two fifty crib a performers were selected a had marks more than eighty four percent we saw that the stock performance has increased to ninety five per cent arm which suggests that the mentorship had its own a gym and an important role to play in this if so but again there were lot of adhoc instructions that had to go due to lot of constraints and the there were many times what has happened is that the moment we schedule a set up abu interactions for mentors and mentees are sometimes the mint is do not actually turn up a mentors have to both mentors or mentees lose precious time due to technical glitches etc so are we understood that they need to be a formal course that introduces these mentors to understand the pedagogy behind supporting a mentees when they have to actually play the facilitation role are in this era where multiple technology features are available to them so the same could be told of a job while you are facilitating moocs or massive open online courses for your students are then the same set of skills you would need to apply with your students such that they could better attempt the mooc activities and learn sufficiently from them there is also another agenda that we had that we have to scale up the piece so that it could reach to larger amount of a teacher audience arm and be a in india the scale is so huge that we have close to for and a half lakh teachers just in undergraduate engineering colleges and the each program we are able to cater up to three thousand to several thousand a teachers still now soup we have trained only around ten thousand teachers still now and we need more such a training programs and vinny to scale them up quickly so that they will be abreast with the latest technology offerings and technologies are also changing so are the same if the piece that you had done a currently a this may get outdated are within two two to three years because the technology changes rapidly are newer and newer technologies are coming in a students are also having access to various kinds of technologies and their interactions are very different compared to what they were maybe an year earlier so each crop of students coming into the education into the classroom are different every year now so that is something that we have received a mini teachers saying echoing this feeling that something like a generation gap that existed earlier when after letter passing out of five batches of are students that has now further gone down so every year
