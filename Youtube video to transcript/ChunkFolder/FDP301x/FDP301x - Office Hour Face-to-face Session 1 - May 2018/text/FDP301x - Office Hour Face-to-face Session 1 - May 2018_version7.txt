the difference so in week one there was about the pedagogy of use of a ladies ladies alexis and alexis are some of the alexs have also changed so we have new resources that talk about what is internet so in fact we have also converted the textual content into a format of a lady so for example if you see or hear are the first few text explains what they are going to see when you can see your reflection spot over here which ask them a question and there is a video that follows it that explains the ah what a be answer to the reflection spot so there are some variations in the format there are some variations in the type of resources that we have used are of course the technology that we have trained them is the same a the first week others are the second week was about use of wordpress to create their own website so the same set of videos that you would have seen in the a in your own epididymis arm the second week was about screencasts so we have discussed about visual presentation are what needs to be looked at while looking at visual presentation and we have so the same video by doctor somehere that you might some of you might have seen it during every interaction and some of you would have seen this as part of your course resource disowned year in which we have offered it so again you can see that there is a taxi there is a reflection spot and there is a bead a contend that summarizes the answers to your reflection spot and all these goes to your raw course journal so the mentees are required to write or your mentees would allow the participants to this particular effort had to write these answers to the reflection spots in their journal and their journal was finally evaluated arm at a tattoo submit their journal at was for the final evaluation a this was in week three i have due to a technical glitch a barbie did not have access to modify content in the course so we had to create a separate course which had weeks four and five so this is the week four and five of the course so week four was about a learning management system a model so we had the same set of activities and videos that he had given to you earlier and in week five we had the summary where they had two they were told about how different technologies were integrated are what all we have used so there this was a five part summary and they were feedback taken from each of the a learner and they were appropriate graded activities each week there was resource creation assignments there were assimilation quizzes knowledge quizzes arm reflection quizzes etc and you could see a lot of participants a posting in the discussion forum where they were exercise these were different with different focus questions and they had to respond to them so this was about debbie bond we evthe too that is going on now are the first week we had introduced them to both digital blooms taxonomy and also the revised blooms taxonomy are the revised blooms taxonomy
