evidence regarding previous if the piece i will not be answering that what is the basic difference between the current and old ones have already explained this is about mentoring and not about learning some technology or how to use the technology effectively but you will be actually using some technologies effectively a during the course and we will help provide your content on how to reflect well or how do you deflect from practice what you need to do to improve your raw reflection process as a teacher how many mentees will be allotted to one mentor a as far as possible they are we are trying to limit the number of mentees to a four to eat and not move so unlike last time were you had fifty a mantis at this time around will have a lesser number of mentees to actually mentor in the session you mentioned few points you are not familiar with the ah so whatever i have told today that will be appropriate content in the course to actually tell you about the tell you about the details of those particular terminology or jargon will twentyseven be june deadline for reflection phases also yes so for all graded activity in this course twenty seventh june is the final due date so there is a question that please allocate mentees who are active and doing wire so that theyll be they will respond to us we hope that most of the empty two participants are active so in case your mentees not active and does not submitting we are please do not worry at all a be will factor in some kind of alternate mechanism to include the ten percentage in some way will try to factor in activeness of the mentee and whether they have submitted completely but having said that you should also try to make your mentees more active or not because you are being graded but because a because it is a process for them to learn so think of this as a scenario where you are trying to encourage backbenchers in your class to study and submit a study well and do well in exams write the exams submit an assignment course assignment think of a similar scenario we are very much aware of the practical constraints arm that are involved while doing this entire process so we will definitely consider those exceptional cases where the mentees are not active but having said that it is up to you to make sure that your mentees are active and they understand the process level okay so there is again a similar query that some mentees are only meant for working towards certificates so consider the same scenario youre facing that even in your raw classrooms as well most of the students are only worried about the final exam or the assessments and the arm btec certificate or the uji certificate that comes after passing the exam how will you encourage your london isnt a problem that we are all trying to solve what all strategies will you try to coax these learners too
