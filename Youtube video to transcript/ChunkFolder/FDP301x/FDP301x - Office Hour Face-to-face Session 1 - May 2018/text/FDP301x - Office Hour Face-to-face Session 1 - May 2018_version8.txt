if he was an assimilation quiz so there wasnt for it was an extension resource it was not if people had already been familiar they need not look at it again but it is we suggested we recommended that they look at it to refresh their memory about revised blooms taxonomy the second week was about the flipped classrooms the why what and how they were learning extension resources about flipped classroom at the third week which is going to release today is about active learning which is actually the inclass segment of a flipped classroom a there will be introduced to the active learning strategies of think pair share and the peer instruction in this particular week the final week there is a slight modification will be also talking about use of evaluation adage kirkpatricks level of reaction and learning would also be told to them because they would need to do a self evaluation or get evaluation metrics to complete their we are so we will use that to actually explain how evaluations could be done and we will be looking at various are ways in which you can actually evaluate your own practice and the basically a improve your own practice based on the evidence that you collect from the ground while your doing the teaching learning practice so this is about evto again if dippy too also has a discussion forums with focus question are we will encourage learners to involve themselves in the discussion forum and share their experiences are for the first week a baby would strictly ask you do not to be in god a post anything in the discussion forum you be mere observers so as part of the activity across the next one week be mere observers of the course understand how the course has been built understand how different how we conceived the entire if defeat design how the various components are a in a form provided in the a in a very sequential format and what we are trying to do with these particular hefty piece so you would be passive observers for to this to these two hefty piece for the first week in aberdyfi three zero one and you should make a lot of reflection notes in your core journal about the entire if dtype design what has happened what did you see a what were some shortcomings which could be improved with better facilitation etc so this is something that you should be doing a while you are observing if dtype three zero won you doing the arm doing the of decreased one in the first week but will be supporting you with adequate content that will help you out in and activities that will help you out in this process so if dtype three will be totally driven by a majority of learning extension trajectories or alexis and exercise they will be a lot of small everyday activities but they be few compared to the learning extension trajectories and alexis that are required in actual matry so you could discuss what could be good scenarios you have also the experience of mentoring wants and you know the practical constraints that are involved in while doing an eft so each of you could benefit from these
