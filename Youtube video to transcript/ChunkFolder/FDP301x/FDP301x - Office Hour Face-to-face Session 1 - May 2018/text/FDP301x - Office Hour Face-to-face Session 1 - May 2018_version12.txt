how do you write a program how do you compile a program what is what you mean by compiling all this knowledge is something a be college content knowledge and there is a third piece of knowledge which is actually needed for you to do effective teaching learning in classroom and this is what we call the pedagogy knowledge sorry for the so there is this third part which is known as pedagogy knowledge it is about lets say you have idea of how to use a particular pedagogy up inside the classroom for example how to what is think pair share why is it used what are its advantages are these form what is known as the pedagogy knowledge that is needed for a teacher to do effective teaching learning inside the class citizen knowledge about strategies why or why a strategy has to be used all these forms your pedagogy knowledge now if you actually look at this venn diagram you can see these intersection areas so there is something known as technology content knowledge which is actually over here so this is the technology content knowledge area so for example i am using a view to teach computer science one no one to my students so i create basic slides up for might a session on computer science won one and i use a view feature of document upload to upload this and stream to all students now this is an example of technology content knowledge so how to teach a particular content or how to present a particular content using a technology feature this is what we call technology content knowledge this comes in the intersection between technology and content so i may also use a pedagogy of something like peer instruction while using a view so for example i will ask all my students to initially i pose a question in a polling mode file use a oil pose a question arm in polling and i lose i decide that i use a polling feature of a view to actually do this peer instruction and this is what is known as technology pedagogy knowledge so to facilitate peer instruction using a view i will use the polling feature in a view and i lose students to discuss with each other after they commit to the answer file know how to orchestrate a peer instruction session using it so this is the technology pedagogy knowledge and there is another important feature which is called the pedagogy content knowledge the means i will be able to tell you for which feature should i use peer instruction so this is a forum a peer instruction is useful for helping students to attain better conceptual knowledge and in my content lets say the conceptual knowledge about arrays is what students should have so i will use the pedagogy of peer instruction to teach
