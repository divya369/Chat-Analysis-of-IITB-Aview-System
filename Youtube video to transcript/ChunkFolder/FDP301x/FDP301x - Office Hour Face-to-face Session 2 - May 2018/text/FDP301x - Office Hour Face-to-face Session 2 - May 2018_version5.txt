a content interaction activities all these needs to be put in your moodle course a do not worry we are going to give you guidelines to better understand badiou essentially the idea is that your moodle course will be worth eight hours to a hub for a new learner then are you going to specify the content delivery mechanism to be used up so the there is nothing like content delivery mechanism a worthier suggesting as the learning management system that you use for creating this a if dtype design activity should be model a in the development of my own topic for dissemination to the mentees will i get a chance to use openid wcs platform or see if you have system capacity to handle open idiots please feel free to a create your own instances of open idiots arm it require sufficient seem a open index is a mooc platform massive open online course platform and that works well when you have a lot of users like say ten thousand to one lark that many users if they are accessing the course simultaneously that is where a platforms like openids are more appropriate your ra number of meteors that are allotted to you will be very less or mid mill not be more than it for sure so i would not recommend use of openid wcs platform rather model is more a convenient and its pedagogy itself is more suited for constructivist use enhance that will help you a lot and you your own expertise is in muddle through the efforts you have come across various a muddle modules so it would be better that you use a model for this a particular if dtype design activity so there is a question regarding if dtype creation using peapack ah its just written application using deepak are i do not understand what this question was the what this question was about but essentially the of debby design activity if you actually consider it is a te pack activity so it helps us in a judging or evaluating your rottie part levels that is what this is about a stupid design activities about okay so there are questions about mentor mentee interaction a lot of them i think a would be a similar as in a personnel at aptitude of mentees so they are there is a question so let me address the most easiest of them first or the question a that was posted says is it possible to have mentor mentee interaction after six or holidays or sundays should or should it be a synchronous communication only can email communication alone serve as an interaction so are the answer is yes to the first and third which means that you can do interaction a though at a through whatever medium you you and your mentees prefer and the timing could also be across a across time it could be totally asynchronous using email that is also a completely acceptable are the only thing is that if suppose there are a many of these are warm interaction that
