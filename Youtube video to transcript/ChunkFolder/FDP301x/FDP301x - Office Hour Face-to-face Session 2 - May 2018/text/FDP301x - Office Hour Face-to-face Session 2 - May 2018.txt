i was in a weeks time so that we will have war will have an idea of how many mentors are actually available and how we can distribute the groupings of the main piece with the mentors are now a expensive how this office hours is going to work day there we had put up a survey in a complex course i hope all of you have accessed the afc three course arm so the first set of material the basic introduction to peapack a ater was provided yesterday arm these were i knew these were a very few materials which gave you up some clarity some initial clarity on what tea packers how teabaggers apply to a particular course of some additional resources variety pack is explained further the various levels at which artie pack operates etc was a detailed arm and we had asked a survey regarding and we had looked at three different aspects or the types of queries that you will be having arm once the procedural queries second is a technical a sort of queries a third is a conceptual queries so we have several a queries that were so close to it seven people have posted their queries yesterday and our core team a is actually a cons have consolidated pby major set of queries and they are now arm up classifying them into a multiple category so if you look at the whiteboard over here so ill be first discussing about the procedural queries are the ones that come from the idf deputy so there are seven types of queries that we received the first one a type is regarding the course coverage so they were are some questions regarding the arm a questions regarding the due dates of activities so let me reiterate the due dates of act all the activities are end of the course that means it is a self paced course so you can submit till the last date of the second a question is how to work up a inn in this particular course so we will be as i told yesterday every three days will be releasing content are to be having a release the first set of content a yesterday the next set of content would be released on sunday are then every three days you will have content uploaded in the ideo bombax still june first all the major graded activities will start only from june first because this this is the entire time that you would require to actually assimilate the content explore the previous safety peace or try to understand what is happening or make sense of the material so the first set of graded activities will be released on june first and the second set of graded activities will be released on june fifteenth a details of be are graded activities will be informed you are next week but for the first a week or this entire week please spend your time understanding the content and do not worry about any graded activities okay so til june first you do not have to worry about any graded activities after june from june first onwards we will have a graded activities posted so the first major set of graded activities will be released on june first the second set of graded activities will be released on june fifteenth and if you have time till june twenty seventh to complete the graded activities are the next question are in course coverage as theres a asking me will the assignments of the safety be similar to those of other apis so a the nature of assignment as in knowledge vessels assimilation quizzes would be similar however the reserve very drastic difference because this is an advanced if all the other two if dtype won and if dtype to wear foundation of the peace and hence be primarily looked at you exhibiting some sort of expertise in a or be some sort of skills that you showed was sufficient to get you a good grades but whereas in hefty three you need to work hard your designs all these are going to make a lot of difference the assessment mechanism will also be very different we are actually we have tried to do something to eliminate the peer review shoes are by looking at the actual performance of your peers while they are interacting with your designs etc all the peer review activities will also be some type of engagement which your pia has to do with some of the course are things that you create and their evaluations will be available to all of us so please wait for a week to get more idea about how the peer activities how the design activities etc are going to be a put up in the ultima makes all the design activity submissions will start only from june fifteenth soap till a june first you need to worry about content that has been uploaded so go through the content reflect on what if dip one end of deep it was about look at the performance and focus on are get a mentoring a providing mentoring to your raw mentees will be assigned to you okay so the next major question arm regarding course coverage is a content delivery mechanism is best with activities and video soup yes so the activities are there so if you from sunday we will start all the activities by just logging into the content did a weed did not want you to be too much loaded with a dippy three content cause youll also need to understand the procedure you also need to understand the contents slowly soup this time is provided you to get familiarized with the way in which the safety is operated this is a entirely different from the standard if dip is that we are doing this a relies more on asynchronous online and online communication there are no r see specific a details over here are this is each of you have been a given the freedom to choose are the modality that you prefer to interact with the instructor the instructor is available virtually on specific dates and the other things are posted in the iati bombayites are of course so this is slightly different from the base in which the other if dips are conducted so get familiarized with the format of the sap dippy get familiarized with asking questions asking relevant questions etc once you get to know this process then you will be able to better appreciate the okay the next set of questions is regarding if dtype design activity so there are a variety of our questions regarding arm what needs to be added soon i was a funny question i do know who has this really iority bombacks is not going to provide a lady in this course see all the ladies you are already familiar with whatever the knowledge transmission is required so the specific components which requires more debt and other things you have all all already experiences content there arent any new information pacy about debbie that we have to tell you we just want you to reorient yourself about this your own if dtype experience are base on the basis of technology pedagogy and content knowledge are the model of te pack that is why we are providing you with a alex teas and they will be alexis shortly but there will be learning by doing activities so there will be lot of learning by doing activities in the coming days but that is only for practice and not meant for so they arent any new information transmission that we are doing a job many of these new information you will be a creating yourself r this a you have a network of individuals a l along with you and this is how a actually this is what we call socially constructed knowledge so we are giving you more a ownership in terms of even content creation so you can suggest a new content through the discussion forums you can provide new content that will help help in explanation you can provide more raw information and wherever there needs to be some clarity in some sort of conceptual or procedural technical aspects of it that is where the office hours comes into the picture and all the videos so all the youtube videos of office hours will also be uploaded in a view so this is the a what if after the end of today will be uploading both the recorded a youtube sessions in ichiban bbc so incase somebody missed out on any of these officers are on fridays both days content will be uploaded into a high tiber makes a coarse feel have a section titled office hours and all the videos of office hours would be available they are there is a question regarding a dippy design on what basis the group will be formed for if dtype design is it possible to give a chance for selecting our pier so that we can interact effectively are so as i explained yesterday the dippy design activity is a group activity and over here we are not going to give you the flexibility of choosing your peers are for the first time around we are putting you in teams so that we want more people so people across or cease to interact with each other so within your artsy you anyway interact with your colleagues but across our seas so the safety petrie the larger aim is that we develop a community which is strong so to ensure that the community is strong we need to ensure that the risk cross are interactions between the various community members who lets a one person from a banarsi arm is grouped with another person to three percent from two or three other horses then what we have seen is that there is a lot more interaction a possibility of interaction that you are required to work out of your comfort zone but still there are lot of productive activities that happen and you have already done mentorship see you all of your colleagues so we hope that the basic info the basic interaction rules are in any collaborative process will be well maintained and since you are all faculty members i completely trust you your judgment while you are interacting with your group members this is very specifically to ensure that there is lot more information transmission across different places see a one major problem that we have seen while doing many of these every piece is that there is very less of interaction between one a horsey and and other artsy there are lot of things that each colleagues see as individuals also am learning a lot of new things from many of the participating teachers so similarly there is this learning opportunity that is available for all of you while youre working with a members outside your raw physical proximity a there is lot more new things that you will learn they are so you have all interacted at least once a during the previous every piece either via discussion forum or through some other mechanisms while your doing a the ebu interactions over here but what we want to make us we want to explicitly make this connection more stronger so that we get a good community of instructors who can help us in scaling these faculty professional development effort and see it is a lifelong learning process for any teacher learning never stops and we need to be ready to move out of our comfort zones work with different individuals yasu over here there is a very specific tasks for which your working but yeah the boundaries are set for the task but there is lot more that you can do and no one is stopping you from interacting with people from euro nazi a lot can happen even so we are not saying that you should not interact with other group members we actually encourage people to interact across groups also so see a try to utilize the groups creation process to interact with more number of people interact with multiple groups so that you get lot more idea about how you can effectively do a mentoring online or using educational technology tools so why do so that the question can we prepare our own course material in moodle so this is regarding the ft design activity see the updated design activities very a targeted they are targeted modules that we have identified which is related to the eff dippy content so if you actually look at are the updated design process it is actually are you showing us that you have achieved the te pack for the content knowledge of how to use a particular technology how to use a particular pedagogy four are doing teaching learning off if the content so we are through this particular course we are also this particular activity we are trying to ensure that you have sufficient te pack to a new exhibit sufficient impact to provide information about the eff dippy content and do a effective teaching learning with it so that is what a this updated design activity is about all this has to be a small moodle course so you know that adam a every module is worth one week of far in the online space which is effectively participants had to interact for a six to eight hours with the content and with other people in the courts to six to eight hours worth a content interaction activities all these needs to be put in your moodle course a do not worry we are going to give you guidelines to better understand badiou essentially the idea is that your moodle course will be worth eight hours to a hub for a new learner then are you going to specify the content delivery mechanism to be used up so the there is nothing like content delivery mechanism a worthier suggesting as the learning management system that you use for creating this a if dtype design activity should be model a in the development of my own topic for dissemination to the mentees will i get a chance to use openid wcs platform or see if you have system capacity to handle open idiots please feel free to a create your own instances of open idiots arm it require sufficient seem a open index is a mooc platform massive open online course platform and that works well when you have a lot of users like say ten thousand to one lark that many users if they are accessing the course simultaneously that is where a platforms like openids are more appropriate your ra number of meteors that are allotted to you will be very less or mid mill not be more than it for sure so i would not recommend use of openid wcs platform rather model is more a convenient and its pedagogy itself is more suited for constructivist use enhance that will help you a lot and you your own expertise is in muddle through the efforts you have come across various a muddle modules so it would be better that you use a model for this a particular if dtype design activity so there is a question regarding if dtype creation using peapack ah its just written application using deepak are i do not understand what this question was the what this question was about but essentially the of debby design activity if you actually consider it is a te pack activity so it helps us in a judging or evaluating your rottie part levels that is what this is about a stupid design activities about okay so there are questions about mentor mentee interaction a lot of them i think a would be a similar as in a personnel at aptitude of mentees so they are there is a question so let me address the most easiest of them first or the question a that was posted says is it possible to have mentor mentee interaction after six or holidays or sundays should or should it be a synchronous communication only can email communication alone serve as an interaction so are the answer is yes to the first and third which means that you can do interaction a though at a through whatever medium you you and your mentees prefer and the timing could also be across a across time it could be totally asynchronous using email that is also a completely acceptable are the only thing is that if suppose there are a many of these are warm interaction that they are happening or make it a point that you include this in your course and also maybe you can create a separate section in core journal titled a interactions with mentees and lets say put up screenshots of interaction and write about what happened in the traction so if it is not email lithium putting a screenshot of a interactions a that you had via skype or some other synchronous medium then a put a screenshot of that and below it right down the no down the main points that were discussed in that particular interaction so if it is email then a the email screenshot a sufficient enough as we know what has been discussed in the interaction okay ah another question how can we motivate the participant to include various pedagogical techniques to be included in classroom teaching right from the very semester in which she participates in the afc okay ah this is how do you motivate people to apply the learning content arm so my question to all teachers is how do you motivate your students to learn the basic rules remains the same what incentives will they get me why should they do it um what what are they going to get benefit a how are they going to get benefit out of it you need to tell these to your rob faculty colleagues arm so that they have a bye into the particular idea so unless and until the person has no bine it will be really hard to make them do many of these activities unless it is strictly mandatory that is a different case but ya motivation the principle remains the same or explain why you are doing this what benefits they will get and how well they can do give them some best practices always are the challenges always in the learning curve o in the use of a technology or in learning a new practice so tell them how to best tackle this learning curve what all they should be doing on what additional efforts are required and how these additional efforts are worth putting in so if you give this information that should be four starters that should be a that should work in motivation a so the next question is what is meant is followed different delivery methods mentors find it difficult to monitor it see you dont have to completely monitor your mentees what theyre doing it is if i see this exercise of mentoring soap please note that mentoring is not equal to monetary mentoring means york showing them the path your telling them that yes this is how you can go these are some of the ways in which you can do and this is why you should be doing it now it is completely up to your mentees whether they accept your guidance whether they accept your decision because see mentoring a be are introducing you as knowledgeable peers from or who have experience of doing the safety and who knows some of the benefits of doing this if dtype well now this particular hefty three exercise so many of you had come over to ati bombay had participated in an orientation workshop and we are also a planning to put up a future orientation workshops for a qualified if dtype three participants are in native bombay in the upcoming months are also there are lot of benefits that you will get out of participating in these particular every piece we are looking at developing communities so we we are trying to build a sustainable community who can take forward the larger goal of faculty development programs across the length and breadth of the country are so we need to you we are all working together towards a larger goal that is how we see this entire exercise are so give them more also it is not that you dont have to do micro management so that it has its own adverse effects your mentees maybe working for different they will have different motivation to join this particular program they may each have their own personal choices why theyre doing a particular activity but as a mentor what you are going to give them is basic guidance on what works what are some of the best ways in which this could be done arm and how are this could be a this could be beneficial to you please do not go on nit picking a individual or a day to day or minute to minute activities that is not at all required a sob or the question regarding a what if mentees follow different a so if mentees choose different mechanism lets say one of your mentee says ill interact with you over email another mentee says that you i will interact with you over wrap whatsapp or another person says ihl kaminsky a please feel free to accept it at sea the a the main concept is the mentor and mentee should be comfortable in the track that is the primary part so if your not comfortable with skype you can say that i am a slightly maybe bandwidth is the reason they could be technical issues oh i think this would be a better mechanism but ill be too across the time this is going to be my turnaround time etc so you could say these kind of things and participate in the discussion and the same holds true for raw the mentees as well a man a mentor mentee relationship strange and through personal experience i feel mentees are often reluctant to approach mentors how does one break the ice and make the relationship symbiotic is the challenge that according to me is paramount in this course ah i understand a mentor has to be innovative creative multicentric etc and commenting on the cultural and psychological baggage of this relationship this is a wonderful observation i dono who put this up in this away but a great observation of icebreakers are needed icebreakers op we will try to provide this icebreaker during the aibu interaction are that youre going to have with the eff dippy two participants in the upcoming week so gilby pa will be telling them that all of you soon will be providing you with the abu sayyaf sessions youtube link which you can actually see through a youtube in the upcoming saturday and sunday this is a twenty six and twenty seven so will be formally spending one full session about this entire minty a mentor mentee processes will be formally introducing i you are in the course page but what you can do as mentors is that or maybe you can provide all your ram other resources that you have created as part of the previous year you can consolidate in your personal web page i think all of you have already done it but if you have not done it yet please do that are at the earliest again ill be releasing a survey to consolidate all this a personal web pages are that you created as part of the afc you can put up all the resources that your using not just as part of a ft you can also add additional resources that you have utilized in the classroom so for a mentor a for a mentee to understand yes my mentor is a knowledgeable my mentor is has a wealth of experience this particular thing so this is what we call as a teaching portfolio or course portfolio so this portfolio will introduce you to actually arm to the mentees so it will show them you the approachability with the mentors are of course you could put up a basic a m in your free to put up whatever you wanted the webpage a contact communication how much easily accessible you are all these information you could a that could be made visible through your own individual course portfolio so that could work as a producer for starters that could be a good icebreaker so for example if i am a mentee adds a okay id bombay says i am alerting you to a mentor so why should i look at this mentor so here even as it will be easier for us to say look at the resources created by your mentor in your previous evty so look at the a screencast that theyve created look at the moodle courses that they have created in the last of all dont you think and if you have a evidences or other things that your shed for your own courses you can add the doubts we can also be can actually a show of your mentees that there is there is benefit in interacting with you and they are also going to get a lot of knowledge from this particular interaction so that when there is this tangibility then slowly the barrier is going to break as in that is the first step a in terms of attitude and belief we should ensure that the your raw profiles are in sync with what they are what we intend so the intention is that you can provide best support to the mentee for we are creation so why dont why dont you see this particular mentors a personal web page so they will also be interacting with you and of course youll be ah as soon as we allot your arm alot a mentor to a mentee wheel be formally introducing the mentor to the mentee via email so each of your mentee will get an email telling them that obey this person is your mentor he has done so and so work you can look at his profile in this particular web page so this is the nature of email that actually go so if you have a webpage that will be easier for us for your mentees also to actually look and get convinced that yes this person could be a good mentor for me ah okay last time mentees take debut interaction very casually few of them were unable to interact just because they are not prepared for that well in advance ah yes this was observed in few of the mantis cases are there was this problem of mentor mentee interaction not being very arm arm but a second arm symbiotic for both of them are one reason is that we had only scheduled slots so that is why we are keeping eve you completely out of this measurement interaction this time around are no other reasons but yeah a many times it so happens that the slots a ben we have to do interactions at scale or in groups or we will have certain logistics issues which needs to be a address phone and itll be very difficult if we say that all of you have to use if you then are in that case you will be limited or youll be limited with the white youll be limited with just a view whereas there are lot of technology features other than a view that you can also explore so we are not saying no to a view for this particular offering guessing that lets not use a view because abu is a virtual classroom software so the same rules that a classroom has that means there is a start time there is an end time or it cannot be it cannot be made flexible that okay and i need to enter the class today i need to enter the class tomorrow if this has to be done there are lot of logistical overheads at our end also the means are there needs to be continuous interaction between eighty bombay and the mentors and mentees which actually makes it impossible so we will spend two weeks just doing the logistics and not having worthwhile interactions okay that is why we are not using a view for the current measurement interaction okay last time while mentoring the ment is the main problem i faced was lack of their response a veteran using meals whatsapp chat for communication if most of them does not fail to respond in spite of continuous reminder that creates lots of problems even if the answer is no that should be communicated i personally suggest that make it mandatory for mentees to provide a record of interaction with the mentors as one of the required submission so that interest for betterment interaction would be from both sides are i completely accept the suggestion that there should be something tangible from the mentees also but for this pilot offering see one thing that ive said is mentoring is not equal to monitoring your providing them guidance and it is up to the mentees to decide how they are going to take up your suggestion now abhere said that in the grading criteria are your mentees performance is going to be a major criteria for ra evolution but over there also were given web given you flexibility as in if your mentee score more than fifty per cent then you are youll get the full credits for the mentees are performance only if they go down or off fifty percent that is the only cause of concern and am hoping that your guidance would be sufficient to ensure that they go beyond the fifty percent but even in this case since this is the pilot offering we have a set up mechanisms to ensure that if the mentee has not interacted well with the mentor then dad gets counted in that particular thing gets counted while we are doing that a mentees performance a scenario so we will ensure that that gets accounted for in the a in your own grading as well is there any provisions to valid we are of our mentees first by a so that we can give feedback to improve before the sign final submission so we have recommended that you provide your via submission so it is a recommendation from our site to the mentees that since your mentors have already done the weir activity last year it would be worthwhile that you give your a we are a we are for your mint a mentors to evaluate first so that in case of peer review issues we could take up your mentors evaluation so this particular directory there will be given to your mentee so which also means that there is an incentive for them to actually work with you so suppose the peer evaluation has gone horribly wrong then we will actually utilize a mentors evaluation so this is what we have done last year also whenever they were resource creation assignment issues or peer evaluation issues we have asked them to provide their work to your rub a mentors so that mentors can evaluate the soity bombay trust the mentors and we will take a the mentors evaluation arm as it is a forum for their submission so that particular a directive or recommendation is being provided our we are not strictly enforcing any any of this so it is completely up to the mentees to decide what they would want to do but yeah this is also an incentive and i think this is a good incentive to give them a right upfront so that they will diligently interact with you so there is a question can i provide a sample copy of we are to your mentees yes please please provide all the sample we ask that you have created some other open educational study updated up apart from the ones that you had did for a freebie but give them several exposure to several different resources that you created across the duration of the ebs a okay this question is regarding does preserve annex mandate all hef to have to be done by mentors how many active f has to be done between mentors and mentees sudan know there are no requirements for face to face interactions as i said it could be synchronous interactions through a virtue any virtual medium or it could be completely asynchronous interactions like whatsapp and emails are the only thing is that you have to be in touch with your mentees and you should have a pulse of what is happening to your mentees thats okay theres a there is this question i feel the aspect of replying the queries to participants is a challenging task because of linguistic and accent differences although the medium of interaction is english the language used for verbal communication is majorly influenced by vernacular languages making it a challenging job to understand the content of the pests are i agree a even now we face a similar issues while we are doing the ebu interactions or replying to the discussion forum queries are a at this moment a bot i would recommend is that you ask more probing questions to elicit what exactly they want or we will try to see whether we can have people with similar language be assigned to a to you but yeah we cannot completely a say that you will get people who are familiar with languages that you speak or that we cannot be hundred percent sure because the diversity of the if dtype itself is a major challenge that we are trying to overcome but as far as possible will try to ensure that the linguistic challenge will be minimized and that we have some mechanism to actually arm a factor in the various regions that each of you represent okay so the next this was all about a mentor mentee interaction or the next is about evaluation scheme are the so in the evaluation scheme the first question is what criteria can be used to evaluate ourselves as a matter we can take feedback from mint tea but delete it for ourselves will there be any rubric or we are free to valid ourselves on the basis of criteria for choice so they are standard facilitation evaluation rubric so see this is what i told about the kirkpatricks level are the mentor mentee interaction is a form of small training and there is a first level interaction as in a do does your mentees perceive enough usefulness and satisfaction after interacting with you that is one metric that you can take the second metric is or whether they have learnt something out of it out of the interaction with you over the next over a lengthy two to three weeks that you can administer small surveys and it will also be so the we are assigned group discussion kind of activities some may involve a lot of problem solving activities the pedagogies may be different but the other is no domain dependency a question regarding a allow us to select and farm team ourselves are unfortunately it is not possible have told you the reasons for that ah okay this is an interesting question please give an example of how the muddle base if deeply content develop in present if dtype will appear a okay so let me take you to a moodle course i share the desktop with you a in a in a minute so this let me login to a moodle course here are just hold on for a moment or i share the screen with you so i hope prgh i all of you are able to see the gyno mu site that we have a moodle site my our moodle site an example model site that gave developed in jnu new that has been hosted in a genome you are just log into the system okay so a peer instruction is one of the important modules are in this particular a freebie it is part of active learning also here we have developed a moodle course on peer instruction so this is like a module on peer instruction if you if i were to redesign this particular module how would it would be so this sphere instruction it has a feedback form to be filled so all the people were coming in they can use this particular a feedback form to actually log into it and give the feedback so their feedback about the sphere expression module will be captured here ah so there are videos so you can see the lady videos for parents section followed by liddy and there is restriction settings so unless and until you are a mardi activity is complete you not be able to access their bodies so we have a ladies and ladies designed like this so there is a discussion forum with a focus question and its associated reflection quiz which is the learner experience interaction are and thus they are electrcity videos are to extend their understanding of aam peer instruction there are assimilation quizzes we have also added a what you said other learning extension videos regarding multiple technologies and what you mean by integrating technologies while using appear instruction so there is also an activity for designing their own pee and there is actually a peer review of the pies were rap just like association assignment that we do authorize the workshop module to actually do a peer review of the peer instruction activities that they have created so the entire activities so this is exactly are the peer instruction in a the current module is not as extensive as this we just have basic appear instruction videos only in the current course but this is actually taking it further so this is another different interpretation of how peer instruction could be taught two different participants we have put up are different resources also for that so this is an example of how a word you say how you can design a module of the safety as a moodle course a chemical engineering okay sudan a request for including chemical engineering domain also ah yes so will add that also do the domain so the domain is already there but will ensure that others are available to minimize the confusion could you provide the entire alphabetical list of abbreviations with meaning are used or being used in my fd one zero one six two zero and accent rejuvenex ah this is a very bad bakery yes we will upload are this alphabetical list and will provide that nifedipine rejuvenex also a okay the question please kindly let us know will you send us the schedules of all activities such as quiz assignment submissions etc in advance a yes i am telling you in advance that four if dtype three activities first set of graded activities will be released on june first are the second set of activities will be released on june fifteenth or you have entire month a june first two june twenty seventh two complete this activity okay other the question are electronics and communication engineering bean which domain or electronics and the ark telecommunication instrumentation etc would fall under electrical and alight so electrical is the parent domain four roar which for many of these sub or many of these allied dummies okay ah can you let us know what is the format of the original as i said there are no standard format for kernel but yes if you want something like a template what i would say is that a first you should have a noting on what you learnt from this particular effort then the second part should be about how the learning from the safety is a going to influence your practice and third is the third part of the coast journal should also have the mental record of mentor mentee interactions these three are bare minimum art at sections that are required in your course journal so ensure that you have these three parts a separated in the original oak there is a question i suppose we are is to be done in groups by debbie two participants yes we ariza if dtype two activity so will we have mentees in groups or individuals so youll have mentees in groups that is what we are actually looking at your trying to see arcevia trying to collect all the groups information by twenty forth aso as soon as we have been alot you op mentees are the mentors would be one single group not the people from multiple groups of a kindly repeat the three mandatory parts of the original the three mandatory parts are learning your learning from a ftp three are how you are learning from eff depetris going to affect your practice and third your interactions with a mantis evidences or details of your interactions with your mates can be form a group involve in mentor mentee interaction so i am supposing that this is about a formation of groups of multiple mentors coming together and doing mentor mentee interaction that is also welcome is there any standard format for feedback form formality there are no stars i was in a will give you some example questions so you may use those same example questions itself to a capture the quality of interaction from your mentee or you can devise appropriate question suppose have done something new in the mentor mentee interaction so you also need to capture that also in the survey so there is a basic skeleton that we are giving you you can decide to use the skeleton as it is or add on to it a question is are you offering hefty three for the first time yes this is the first offering of eff dippy three but for the last previous suffering we had the mentor mentee interactions across the course a beer now formalizing that into a course so that you will also get a benefit of a learning something new along the mentor mentee interaction a textile engineering and technology see it comes under chemical and allied arm if they are more participants we will definitely consider textile as separate domains so please create life science domain a currently licenses come under basic science are because many times so but there is also bio sciences and allied domains if you feel that you come under the bio sciences or the biomedical engineering and its ally domains feel free to join the bio sciences domain otherwise you can now join the basic sciences group see all these domains will get evolved as more and more participants come in so always new domains will be created after each iteration of deeply okay so there are two important questions what is the effect in reality of deepak on teaching and learning how to implement ipad if you are not able to find required technology that is suitable to pedagogical content knowledge see if your not able to integrate a technology so answering the second question first if you are not able to integrate technology at least ensure that the pedagogic content knowledge there are so taipei comes into picture only when you are planning to integrate a technology so there is no question that if the technology is not found what happens the packers meant especially when technologies present a what is the effect in reality of deepak so what is the effective deepak see the more you understand each of these knowledges the better your practice and that is what is actually judge so for example today you understood how to do some particular activity lets a how to create a glossary in moodle and leather like one of the question that was asked a important terms if we put these up as glossary upfront so you know the pedagogy of doing it and for what content you will have to do the glossary so it actually is improving your own practice so the better you are with the each piece of deepak the better your practice would be an inn this is also in reality there are no ideal scenarios over here a bird i find the corre sergio webb depot preserve annex it is in the first section a introduction after introduction there is a survey you can now do this first i think things to do first i think that is what its titles okay this is an interesting question will you guide the mentor part by part relating with the mentee work or we would really love to do that a will find some mechanism to ensure that so that is why we are giving content in a mode berry oduce a modular fashion so it is not that there is content for entire week so we are giving it piece by piece so and if you actually look at the next piece so will be spiraling across various modules across the course of depth regrow so initially we gave you examples of how what a tea packers and so we give you definitions of aipac and other things i in the next will go deep into teh pack and will show you how tea package useful or how teabaggers are how the teabaggers there in my fd one zero and an ability to zero won derby learning by doing activities through which you will get more insights on what the packers all about a similarly then will talk of farm evaluation self evaluation again evaluation in a hefty piece then will talk of this lunar community how lender community model is actually a scene in a hefty piece and how do you so youll you will first give be given a surface view then you will go deep then you will come back again will have a surface view then a good deep south through this spiraling for module go through multiple contents at multiple death and then that you will be using you have your own practice also so that practice will also inform a guard to a that will be usefull for you to go in deeper into actual application of us all these knowledges so yeah so a hobby or trying that in a certain context or part by part guidance to the mentee are mentors yes we are thinking of doing that but will have to formalize so will have to see how the mentor mentee interactions evolving based on that only we can decide how to support the mentors and our mentors in the process yazoo also this is a question regarding are you from idea bombay team planning anything like allotting mentees from enter from the same institute are itll be very difficult to record them internet interaction if the mentor mentees are from the same institution ah yes are we will try as far as possible that the mentors a mentor mentees are from multiple institutions but under the same geographical area so this is one criteria that we are actually looking at a but she will have to see how much of this is actually possible we also have this larger thing that the diversity may not be sufficient to capture this mix and match so at our end we will try to a use of a will try to use a as far as possible the best grouping mechanism that is available with us so question is what will be the timing for interaction how will i trust be document timing as i said it is up to you documentation also asset would be screenshots it could be put in your kernel you could upload that as a goddess bead i mean video in youtube small videos chunks of videos in youtube etc course te pack only published paper is there no video i hope there are some example videos about what is teh pack and deepak activity module a these are videos not learning dialogues these are videos of you will have learning by doing activities so that is what i said it is not necessary that information transmission should only be done through videos there are numerous other technologies through which you can actually do the information transmission so the videos regarding a if you actually look at it the office are videos that you are that is being recorded in youtube right now these are the meadow mechanisms for a tea bag and again it is not learning dialogue there are long videos a two hour long videos so there is a query that please consider education also as a separate domain as i said all these domains will be considered etsy one more thing we also have to look at is where your mentees are from so for mentees currently we have limited them to fifteen to sixteen domains we are putting the those same domains are in the survey also as we find more a mentees from various diverse domains will be adding them in the ah upcoming iterations of the fft okay so i hope that many so i see that many of you have gone beyond the resources that we have a put up in the course this is actually a bsria are correct way of looking at things but one more suggestion us as soon as you learn something outside the course content use the discussion forum to tell others about what you have a lot so we will have a new discussion forum or a thread or structure where will add something honest learner contributions so you can add all your individual contributions into this discussion forum so that others or your peers will get a benefit out of it are so somebody is talking about the same are model so like deepak sarma is also another kind of model which explain so its like the revised blooms taxonomy the various types of knowledge it is putting it into various different formats a substitution augmentation modification and redefinition a m in a duel you can select what whatever of what is it knowledge models that you find more relatable a it is strictly up to you summer is also a good a learning model a give us a chance to choose spears unfortunately no that is not possible a cme okay so there is a kindly give an example of peapack used in the activity fee deepak is actually building knowledge of the participant so the epdp activity all of you have done a wouldng activity in the first or your created small moodle courses so how did we start we first provided you information about various components of wood for adding a quiz or adding a video adding discussion forums etc so this is actually the technical knowledge related to ah now we also introduce you to the ideas of form appearance struction think pair share etc as pedagogies now you could have also something like peer review is a kind of peer instruction soupier view can be considered as a peer instruction strategy so be at the workshop module is the ideal tool to actually give you peer instruction as long as it is not graded that could be used as a peer instruction strategy too so this is about a technology and pedagogy and the content selection for each time a it is about what content you are teaching so suppose you want to teach peer instruction in moodle using peer instruction method i use something like a workshop module in moodle where i elicit participants to first upload appear instruction activity and make them do a cross evaluations so this is how hty pack are as relevant suubi correlate peapack too a addy if dbh activity so there are these whatsapp groups that have been created are in a baby so a a many of us are part of this are if dtype whatsapp group so people who find it comfortable to use whatsapp groups please join one of these whatsapp groups and start interacting with a yo appears so that many many discussions are happening swipes a lot of discussions happening in these whatsapp groups that will also be beneficial for you to actually interact with each other okay so this is regarding a somebody who was not part of the mentoring process last time around are a have they missed something so do not worry were not missed anything in detail because even these mentors syria are constantly learning from our previous safety peace or how we implemented and beer making small small modifications to our offerings and our pedagogical practices as well so there are no major are things that you have not a missed but what you missed is that okay there was this exercise of mentor mentee interaction last time around are and we learnt a lot of new things from it and that is why the safety three was created be thought of structuring a focusing it on very specific topic and also providing you are an incentive to be a mentor that is why this was the subtype has created people asking again for sample code journal format please note have repeated it many number of times there are no specific templates three important sections are there a mandatory sections are required your learning are a your ram reflection based on the learning how it informs your practice and if your having betterment interactions are that also as the third element in the course journal for more details on core channel please go and visit a fd one zero one eggs are there a mention what the scots journal is about or see the moment we standardize a particular thing everyone will be following the same aspect we also need a diversity to see how your reflecting about your own practice that is what this course is about teaching learning is a very dynamic process and each of us have a very different way of approaching the thing but yeah i understand that guidelines are helpful and that is why the
