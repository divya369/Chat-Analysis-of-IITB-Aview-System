there will be given to your mentee so which also means that there is an incentive for them to actually work with you so suppose the peer evaluation has gone horribly wrong then we will actually utilize a mentors evaluation so this is what we have done last year also whenever they were resource creation assignment issues or peer evaluation issues we have asked them to provide their work to your rub a mentors so that mentors can evaluate the soity bombay trust the mentors and we will take a the mentors evaluation arm as it is a forum for their submission so that particular a directive or recommendation is being provided our we are not strictly enforcing any any of this so it is completely up to the mentees to decide what they would want to do but yeah this is also an incentive and i think this is a good incentive to give them a right upfront so that they will diligently interact with you so there is a question can i provide a sample copy of we are to your mentees yes please please provide all the sample we ask that you have created some other open educational study updated up apart from the ones that you had did for a freebie but give them several exposure to several different resources that you created across the duration of the ebs a okay this question is regarding does preserve annex mandate all hef to have to be done by mentors how many active f has to be done between mentors and mentees sudan know there are no requirements for face to face interactions as i said it could be synchronous interactions through a virtue any virtual medium or it could be completely asynchronous interactions like whatsapp and emails are the only thing is that you have to be in touch with your mentees and you should have a pulse of what is happening to your mentees thats okay theres a there is this question i feel the aspect of replying the queries to participants is a challenging task because of linguistic and accent differences although the medium of interaction is english the language used for verbal communication is majorly influenced by vernacular languages making it a challenging job to understand the content of the pests are i agree a even now we face a similar issues while we are doing the ebu interactions or replying to the discussion forum queries are a at this moment a bot i would recommend is that you ask more probing questions to elicit what exactly they want or we will try to see whether we can have people with similar language be assigned to a to you but yeah we cannot completely a say that you will get people who are familiar with languages that you speak or that we cannot be hundred percent sure because the diversity of the if dtype itself is a major challenge that we are trying to overcome but as far as possible will try to ensure that the linguistic challenge will be minimized and that we have some mechanism to actually arm a factor in the various regions that each of you represent okay so the next this was all about a mentor mentee interaction or the next is about evaluation scheme are the
