which will not allow you to completely engage in these sessions and that is why saturday and sunday are chosen and if you actually look at the total duration of the courts which is actually two months we are asking you to come only for six days so out of sixty days we are asking you to come only for six days i dont think that is something a large we are asking you a we are providing you with the resources online every week we released the content with the due dates and although things so we are making use of both the facilities are making the best use of both synchronicity an asynchronous okay asynchronously you are accessing the itee bombays page within your own flexible time period and when you are in the lab so for example when you are in the artsy today today afternoon will be entirely devoted to do activity and tomorrow you will be interacting with your other horses now this particular aspect you will not get if you are coming on a monday or or any weekday okay let me now move on to the next are sea or sea are one three five three one four five three along with money so my question is as you said we are activity should be done it so can there be more than three particular where i okay the question is regarding that a maximum number of members in we are group a be would limit it to three in exceptional circumstances we will arm allow four people but not more than food but again it is subject to why a four us we need to have a see that there are no others there are no other to get this person will be left out so the reasons like these so these are the exceptional circumstances and it is on a case by case basis that we will actually approve that particular team so ideally three because then each of these activities each one can involve themselves completely in because we offer mechanical domain people so we are planning to book them together so in those kind of circumstances we do allow a lessee within an hour he asks why dont you split yourself into two groups of two which is indeed a better solution if ya would ya so if you have four people it is easier for you right there is two people in one group two people in another group i can be a good way but we are planning put together can we do that are so in this case i would specifically recommend you to form two groups because you need a all fee it is not about forming the group you need to get practice with the activity of both courts creation and model and also on how do you report a such kind of we are so this activity if you have not experienced you will lose out on the critical aspect of the safety that is why we want two to three members per team acacia theatre we are will be of two candidate right yes yes our group or group were groovin where yes okay next question from a peer hello hello
