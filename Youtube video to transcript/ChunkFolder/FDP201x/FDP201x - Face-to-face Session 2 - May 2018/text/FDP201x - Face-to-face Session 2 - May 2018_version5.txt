students i have discovered that people find it difficult to prove a set numbers like rootwork erastes very simple proof its a very elegant proof but many stones mess now i have studied that would have seen multiple explanations i believe that my explanation would be very good i could create just a three minute video clip mostly it is audio mostly sub gestures add some writing and these three minute video clip is created which explained the students as to how to prove route to the rest done ill give it a filename maybe debbie phatak video what dot a before that i am i we submit that and i will put it in my muddled or whatever but please realize that this name alone does not characterize everything that is stated in that five minute video clip should we not associate at least the following tags with that a number one mathematics number two arab rule number three irrational number number four debbie fortin number five i te bombay number sex may two thousand in number seven etc writes a tragic what are we doing were actually creating meaningful meta data to be associated with the digital as believe me this happens everywhere in the world although we are concerned with academic voyour but let me give an example from real lie there are people senior executives who receive thousands upon thousands of emails sometimes an email comes which is actually important but it is said by someone whose name i forget that subject line does not contain exactly what that subject is about and how many times we spent how much time we spend in just trying to go through thousands and thousands about in asking why and that is because we dont correct raised the subject line specifically if we wrote adequate number of phrases and keywords in that subject line everybody would be able to understand and everybody would be able to see a tag like the tag phrases that i mentioned are essentially the same thing which will help not only you but anybody else in the world to very quickly search a meaningful identified vac digital asset that you have so i would like to conclude this part by static numberwhat create we are for each of your courses and number two do not create and submit a dwi or upload it on moodle unless you have created an appropriate meta data which will help them to search that it is not only for them for example you know i mentioned it last time the deity bombay is creating we have built a cloud for the national virtual library of india and its pre petabyte active storage cloud and will be releasing our we are repository why end of me we would insist that anybody who submits a digital asset to be included in the open educational resource repository must give adequate number of tags in metadata form others will not expect except that the we are even though it might be of high quality i guess we believe that with millions of learners across the country at the world access our rcia repository there must be able to pinpoint their sir very quickly and very correct and that will not be possible unless theyre adequately treat please understand that you submitting and we are and then somebody is creating that meta data just doesnt
