what all did not work well and then make suitable improvements in the next part of the arm a next offering or the next successive activity that you do a do a for example in the teaching learning scenario does the same classroom when you integrate one technology in the next class menu use the same technology will learn from the pitfalls and you will learn from the advantages and use these technologies effectively and it is a continuing process so we learned a lot from use of these technologies and we try to as a teacher we always try to improve ourselves and for that practice is required and on top of practice reflection on practice is required this exercise is meant as an aid towards eliciting reflective practice from and we have asked you a the three important hints that we provided along with the question is how you can frame the answer so while answering please ensure that you provide clear examples of how you have used i sit in your teaching learning are the writing has your reflection on the changes that you have absorbed and you provide a minimum of one instance of student reaction or student feedback on the use of icity so these are the three main elements that we are looking from this are in while you are answering now to see an example submission we have updated that in the course submission window right now or ill just go to the application right now okay so what you have here is the course if dtype two zero one and changed to student mode and in the big two graded activities right below the rubric so this is the rubric item through which evaluations will be done but right below the rubric you can see an example of a submission so this is a from a past a hydration of the app so you can see that the teacher has said that i city has been proven to be a game changer for teachers like me evidence of usage that they are telling is i extensively use powerpoint for some purpose pedias interactive simulations facebook and whatsapp arm so these other technologies that the teacher uses inside the classroom a look at what they have said for student feedback students enjoy these resources and are very much excited when they use simulations one student has explicitly written a facebook post of how simulations help in clarifying the concepts that are he learned this was widely shared by his friends from other colleges so here what we mean by evidence of usage is something that you have absorbed as evidence of usage or change within your classroom and explaining that you need not do actual classroom are right now to post this evidence it is from your own experience of how your students have shared or how students a how yours wouldnt have said that up how use of these technologies were found
