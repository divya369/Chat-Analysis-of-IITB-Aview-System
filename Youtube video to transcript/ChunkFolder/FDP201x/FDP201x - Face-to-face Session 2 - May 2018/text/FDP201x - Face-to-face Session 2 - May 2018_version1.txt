but earlier that is something that we need to emphasize to ourselves first and adopt a teaching methodology which will involve students which will be student sentry a learner centric and which therefore will emphasize activities discussions collaborative problem solving and so it is in this direction that you will find this workshop on pedagogy will take you further many of you must have already understood the importance of pedagogy many of you might have been already practicing it but this is where we collectively apply your mind and become ardent followers of a well defined so thats the first thing that i would like to emphasize repeat technology is very nice very useful but it is useful only provided there is an associated pedagogy which has been well tested well established and therefore well adopted by all of us in our teaching learning process the second point is when in learner centric moocs we talk about collaboration between learners it goes without saying that there must be collaboration amongst teachers it will give an example of a course which in most colleges is taught by multiple teachers a first course in computer programming which is an obligatory course for all students of any branch of whinging are typically five or six teachers would teach that course in y the system we have a single teacher addressing the students in two batches but earlier we used to have multiple teachers invariably these teachers would come together at least once a week discussed the common problems decide on the corrective course of action sometimes i observe a weak student in my class and decide on an approach which helps that student if i share that with my other colleagues they might have similar cases and my solution might not have occurred to them collaboration therefore is an extremely important aspect of the modern teaching learning process even if i am teaching a course alone doesnt it make sense for me to go back and talk to other colleagues have taught that courts earlier or some other colleagues who might be teaching that course in future consequently i would strongly suggest that develop the ability to collaborate and cooperate with others it will give you an opportunity to discuss pertinent points that you have observed i had to learn similar party in points from others who have observed these or have come up with these while handling their own teaching learning classes to emphasize this collaboration in this particular workshop you would be required to do a team assignment i think youre all familiar with it jacob will be elaborating it further it will primarily be concerning creation of an ohio but the essential idea is that you work in a collaborative fashion traditionally we have assumed collaboration to be possible only when you are physically together as a team such as colleagues in a college or students in a classic but modern technology permits collaboration to be effectively carried out even if you are at distant places email is just one example there are a large number of collaborative tools for example i think moodle is something that you have been trained to use in the last workshop i believe jackie plans to use moodle extension
