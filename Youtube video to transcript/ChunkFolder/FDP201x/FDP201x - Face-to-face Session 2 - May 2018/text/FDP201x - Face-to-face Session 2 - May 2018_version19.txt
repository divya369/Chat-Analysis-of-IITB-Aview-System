okay as per the demand wise means which we are going to summit on honor before twenty photo me okay my second question is if more participant in a particular domain or a nazi then how to break down or say the audis yeah okay third question is what should i do for outstation seventy three participants which you have been allotted newly then i have to put their attendance or upon the group group okay so all workstation is okay but question is moreover tannaim as archie yet pleasant the are secreted muddle or participant created wood oak ah okay so there are four questions let me clarify so i believe there is a white disconnect about oh yeah activity and group activities supposed to be done at yars okay the where activity is a course project activity that has to be done toward the end of the course of that a separate and team formation is a separate thing altogether so are within your r see participants have to identify people whom with whom they can work with and all these participants have to inform the team to the course coordinator who in turn will inform the entire team structure from that are ce too ah i d bombay okay no we are having a seven people from a electronics and communication to mid career oh how we can create the group either you can break it out for three or four poor poor people in the group other famous okay so you can you can bring them down into groups of two to three hours and each see it as it is up see the groping for various participants specific gay are seed need not do anything so participants can find out friends or colleagues with whom they can work on particular topic so they all come discuss among each other what topic they can work hard and together they form groups of two to three so if you have seventeen participants you may have like nine to ten groups of varying sizes two three two two etc or do not go to pfa member groups if you have such large number of participants try to make sure that see the idea of the safety is that each faculty should be able to practice and when the group sizes small like two to three then only theyll be able to practice the different aspects of open educational resource creation as well as report writing okay so that is why the group number size is given as two and three are regarding the attendance are a with the new participants please provide the same it is the same process itself so you have new participants for the sap dippy so are their attendance and upload in the interface that is provided for attendance uploading the thing is a wretched me even with the outside but egypt they did not contact me will go at morning every day i talked to them over one year and someone said they did not get in the mail that had there been a doll to guide you on it so now the problem with me is that scientific participant even i dont know anyone and you are having in archaic won it and feel at ease now so i will i be able to create that the group accordingly the domain but how i can create the group the out of seventy three as because i dont know them and would get in contact with me oh cant so this is the problem here i
