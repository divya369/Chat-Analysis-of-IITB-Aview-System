okay another doubt irsay did thirty minutes yeah oh thirty minutes is the total duration of the information transmission and assimilation everything no it is only for information transmission the whatever content you put up in the course it should be accessible to the learner within thirty minutes so if you gave a one hour video that may not be s that may not suit your purpose right as a learner so think of your own students will they actually go through even thirty minutes of content outside the new year so that is what we are actually trying to compress your raw information transmission to thirty minutes so that your you can also learn how to manage the moodle course activity within that time thank you yeah okay so off they are okay let me take artsy one one three one ball chains since they are team yeah arci oneman thriven a balcon college please illusion yeah yeah merry thankful to the previous discussions that we had because more often question i mean most of the questions were answered okay do also take of the student assignment plans this particular question data what tool to include in the lesson and does so as to me hit a two minute duration since we are in group it be hauling group it so vital to include soon to make the duration of the lesson he mill you can include any law any resource it could be pedia it could be videos see all see are when you create a property you know the approximate time required to go through the pity rigt solicits a ten slide pippity typically you may take a close two five five to six minutes to go through the content of the pipe it similarly if it is a three minute video you may take three to four minutes to actually process the content of the video if your doing a quiz all its a three questions you may need up approximately five to six minutes to do the entire quiz so you will have to judge what resource how much time based on the link duration and the feature that you have added in the resource so if your put up fifty slides then obviously the student is going to take more than thirty minutes to completely process whatever theyre in the fifty slides right it is one more question should we upload do you lie of the moodle a course on an wordpress are suicide so that it will be accessible to the staunton yes you can do that i was about to suggest this today tomorrow afternoon to upload all this are in the op archive wordpress website but yeah you can go ahead and add that in the archive wordpress website that you created for if the pivot and also want to be the username and password for the muddled i supposed to summon a soe currently create test students appear trying to see whether we can include the others are other students other aa sees into your course will investigate how that could be done more effectively by tomorrow afternoon vacationing kedusha ah so all other raw a teacher or sees a cat we have a list of the groups this year suggests just wait for a moment
