while bottle is a very good platform to contribute individually is also a good platform to work collaboratively in terms of teams and groups and that is something that is very very instead of just a wordpress add hoc collaboration or a confused collaboration as i call it where you to benefit a little but nothing of substance is remembered later i would suggest that each one of you should maintain a small diary apart from other thing that you right there you should write down the best practices that you observe whether theyre among the teachers tonight is a step or whether theyre from your own colleagues in your institute or whether theyre kelly participates each one of you would have done something useful something different but it is effectively only with you share it with others and do learn from others what the best practices why is it imported while we might generally be aware of the best practices we tend to forget those which come from elsewhere and we tend to promote ourselves that is not correct best practices have we learned from the best in the world it doesnt matter who is doing what good thing where as long as that good thing is useful it is therefore important that during this workshop we also try to make a compendium of best practices that you absorb that your lord that your heard i think it will be useful to you in your future teaching the third point that i wish to stress is the open educational resource all of your familiar with via open educational resource in fact the whole open source world particularly the world of content under the open source creative commons licenses beware sysonby essay early jet entire wikipedia is an example i will like to mention two things about open educational resource one is using open educational resources wherever available please remember that the number of such resources are very mean you do a single google search and you will get thousands of articles thousands of explanations thousands of tutorials if you barely give all such differences to your students and ashok that you have done your job of exposing suites open educational resource it would be a very very sad thing you know itll be sad big because like us students also only twentyfour hours a day like us they can only read or peruse through a few things in their spare time that is available recall our own student days even those days in good libraries there would be thousands of books any subject therapy six or seven books as students did we ever read although six or seven valleys some subjects which were of great interest to us perhaps we might have read more than two or three books but did we not as students use the maximum beneficial as a reading to our advantage recharge like guidebooks we chose like fixed prescribed textbooks which was like books from which most of the questions in the exams will appear this is a natural optimization that any student will do consequently it is not only important that you create the complete list collection of all open educational resources available in your feed and of course
