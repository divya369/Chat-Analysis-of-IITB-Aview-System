the duo to a semester long or a two semester long course they cannot afford to do that theyre busy with other things we are therefore contemplating preparation of small modules packages we call them microchiped so for example people wish to know some basics about machine land they wont become an expert in machine they buy it if they get interested they might learn more do we have a course which is just eight hour course eight hours youre a professional abuse has professional of course but you are a professional you would like to learn something about machine what if i am a civil engineer and i would like to understand art machine learning is would i not have a forever introduction which is devoid of all terminology and bombastic words at zone but tells me very simply look this what is machine who knows as a civil engineer i might get interested in future and i might actually become an extremely competent i profession after all such changes will happen but i digress the point is such life books need to be created and we would be creating all of these in collaborative form in coming years as some of you may know i have retired from my formal position as professor but you see iety bombay does not leave me alone and i dont want to leave haiti bombay were married for life rabbi has to continue being associated an over the next ten years i proposed to contribute to lifebook skillbooks anna third issue books which is for school education will i believe that school education will benefit tremendously in the coming decades from the effective use of techno so thats all i wanted to say i will only add that please use this mechanism of synchronous interaction only in india we have this feature only artibonite ravine running this a what we call blended moves nowhere else in the world have been able to use it at this scale we can reach up to ten thousands a teachers at a tie we can also reach up to twenty thousands rooms at a time my colleagues i work my surgeon dikshit and as suzanne and their team have created more than five hundred remote said my advice to them is to create thousand remote centers so that not much majority of them should be able to interact with us but they should be able to interact with each other as well there is a tremendous advantage is synchronous interaction and there is a tremendous advantage in online activity when you combine these two you get you can get the best of both voice is what were trying to do and consequently will conclude this rather longish dress to you by same apart from doing all other things please try to ensure that you maximize the synchronous interaction with your students with garlic teachers with us by participating in such interactive say thank you so much overhead sorry i am handing over to jackie i iced over in out wrongly over but not out of date thank you pros of attack are soil
