important thing regarding what is hip audio video issues needs to be sorted out during this testing slot now are some of the things that each are sea has to ensure is that they have a dedicated a internet line the bandwidth is completely dedicated to the view so that a interactions will not have audio or video issues check your camera check your audio mixers whatever hardware and equipments are there please make sure that you test them properly in this testing slot now are our website has very clear instructions and guideline documents regarding what to do at each place and if if and technical issue happens so i know that regardless of how much ever we prepare there could be a last minute ish your other things we will try to sort it out from our end but it is important that be a remote center ensures that they get appear in the testing slot they check the equipment the testing would not require more than ten minutes so it is to spend ten minutes spent ten minutes to ensure that you get your participants in this episode we get the maximum benefit out of this interaction or the ftp or two is going to start on mi third we evthe one we have warm clothes they deeply one last week and we are now in the process of collecting all the peer evaluation grievances and other things one thing that we have done us all the people who are in the margin or let a between thirtyfive person to fifty percent we have first look that they pair valuation grievances and have seen that a a what could be made or what kind of you our course tees have ensured that all these people a get a hoover have submitted so um among these we had around three hundred or three hundred and seventy five people who were there in this particular list between thirty five percent to fifty per cent of a job around eighty percentage of them had not submitted any one of the assignments and due to which we were unable to give them the mark i completely understand that they are each teacher each instructor is having a lot of academic load and the other activities at their own individual centers but see if we had relaxed the criterion that you could submit either won one resource creation activity or another so there were two resource creation activity and yet selected the best mark so we were working for the faculty so that they could attempt any one of them and still be able to qualify how unfortunately what weve seen is that very few out of these are three hundred odd people were able to finally crossed the fifty percentage cut of criteria and the unfortunately as course instructors we are not able to do anything beyond this now one thing to assure all those participants is that this fd one zero one ex is going to rewrite now we are thinking of continuing these faculty development programs because we have seen that it enables a lot of faculty to a benefit from this and lot of them are actively involved in this particular evty so will be continuing a fd one zero one in a more a lean time where faculty does not have too much academic load arm a will look at a university slots and schedules across the remote centers and will try to fix up a slot in the upcoming semester but yeah the fd one zero one is going to cut a fd one zero one two zero one is going to continue for some more time so will have lot of re runs of this app dippy one zero one eight two zero one and any faculty who had attempted a any one of them will be able to participate in the next if dtype also so we will try to ensure that they will get a chance in the next if dtype arm bar and try to cross the qualifying criteria because we are this at the end of it it is the empowerment activity and we look for building a community of faculty who are empowered to do teaching learning processes online so you know id bombay exe is a platform which offers a lot of blended courses like the safety so it is important that a job and one important aspect of any blended courses is the participation from the local institute and you need a qualified faculty who is able to handle these blended courses we have the skill courses like campus to corporate we are having skill courses in animation we also have these faculty development courses sudies skill courses and teach moocs will continue inity bombayites are but it is important that to leverage the best out of the skill courses the course coordinator be qualified in debbie won and if dippy too will soon release enough dippy three ah which is meant to be a tabiya passing course that is required to be a course coordinator for all the blended offerings from mighty bomb jacks so all the faculty who are successfully qualify in the third if dtype which were soon going to release is will be will be a default recommendation from our site for being course coordinators and are a local coordinate or mentors for the blended offerings from our site now to get into if dtype three it is important that they cross if dtype one if dip an if deputy so in that way we are tying up the faculty development programs to all the other critical a blended courses that we will offer from our site initially we will ensure that people who qualify nifedipine dementors and dab a body shape a mentors or local course coordinators are for the future offerings of a baby to pilot it off you will soon hear about debbie three are from our wrap up a from our outreach team because that is going to be a separate activity in itself will soon be announcing that are for the first offering will be selecting a few it will be an invitation only course and will we have identified a pool of farm i mean people who have qualified with mars greater than eighty per cent in the afft piece combine to be the first a to be there in the initial offering of afdi petrie a details of this will soon follow but our primary agenda is not that primary agenda is all about if deepy too zero one so i was talking about arm the ebu interactions and the technical issues a how to sort out the technical issues the first and foremost issue was about the logistics of far the breakout sessions how to understand the logistics of a breakout session it is important for all the course coordinators to understand how are the course is going to be we have debbie to zero one course is going to be a hefty two course is about more about the pedagogy pedagogy of online and blended learning so will start with digital blooms taxonomy this will be followed by two weeks where we will elaborate flipped classroom activities the flipped classroom activities it has two segments oneness we out of class a wear a suit that is where the knowledge from debbie one is going to help all participants so it is about how do you give a resources do information transmission outside the class so you can use moodle you can use about price or you can use youtube i can use screencast to upload videos to youtube or any other video sharing sites and then disseminate the information but what is more important in a flipped classroom is what activities you do inside the classroom now this will be the focus of week three we will look at active learning strategies that are faculty can use inside their classroom primarily will focus on two main active learning strategies a think pair share and per instruction a faculty can select any one of them and try to design their own activities the final activity is all about evaluating the classroom practice are how do you do a learning evaluation and how do you do a perception evaluation and you will see all the participants will start and we are actively we where activity is equivalent to a course project though the weeks are there are only four weeks of instruction the weir activity will continue after the course also all participants will have to form a team a details of this and going to say in a few slides later but from an artsy perspective there are two aview sessions two weekend debut sessions happening one is on twelfth and thirteenth of may which is a coincides with the start of week two where will start about out of classroom activities in a flipped classroom and the second one as in the start of week four pitches after the end of in class activities in a flip clasp so why are we doing the same sessions as i told earlier a you will have all participants assemble at the same place which means that we can utilize the synchronicity its synchronize all participants are available each one can learn from each other and it also is four collaboration between centers not just faculty inside a center who needs to collaborate faculties across centres also have to collaborate like the breakout activity that we did so these are the two primary rationale why we are having these abuses of course there will be instructor a feedback towards the end of budhi activities so ave you sessions will be having two important components one is a lab session which has to be done inside the arsi you dont need any are aview connectivity for this lab session will be giving your local task that you have to comply now in the previous evty you had done a local task of creation of wordpress web similarly will be giving your local task afford doing and this will be on earth this all participants in the archive has to do during the third and fourth session of day one of a baby if this will be followed by a breakout session the breakout session is focused on getting feedback on the loop plus task that we are she has completed from others so this will be done during first and second session on date so as course coordinators your role in both these sessions are very important so youll have to ensure that all faculty participants from your remote center are on task during both the session to facilitate more clarity about the task this is what the activity will be so on twelfth may during session three and for that is the afternoon session each are se will be given five topics to curate an out of class segment of flip clasp so it is all about flipped classroom now fuel be all horses will be given topics in the morning they will have to identify resources a curate content and prepare an out of class segment of a flipped classroom for the same topic we will ensure that these topics are domain dip in independent so that every participant can take part in this activity so they will not be any domain dependency on these local a topics and on twenty sixth may once have done out of class activity and you know about in class activities are on twenty sixth may the dsa the second weekend interaction the afternoon third and fourth session the lab session will be about creating in class activities for the same five topics so arm regardless of the topic you know what is important in a flip clasp so regardless of a topic important thing us ensure that all the accessibility all other things are they the resources are accurate resources have proper licenses are within an hour see you should ensure that all the people are involved in the curation process all the people are involved in designing appropriate activities the rubrics will also be put in advance and what each arse is going to get is a feedback on so there will be presenting one of these topic the very next day so the very next day they will have to present one of the topic to another artsy on how theyre planning their out of class a and in class activities it during the breakout session so they should utilize the breakout session to get feedback about the in class and out of class activities that they created local now a little bit about we are or open educational resource activity this will start in the fourth week of the course this is equivalent to a project course project activity the open educational resource we are now creating a standard a standard all participants or add participants have to form a team the team will have a two to three a persons from ideally from the same mercy because they can interact with each other and ideally from the same domain so that the resource created is more meaning or what they have to do as a new york creation of a moodle course and preparing a report on now the open educational resource is your moodle course and there will be evaluated based on a project report now how do you evaluate your students in a course project activity or of be tech project activity so they will do a project right so they will create something but it is not just the creation that is evaluated it is also the process that they have gone through so you will ask all your be tech students to submit a detailed project report beta project report or a course project so we are also asking the participants to create a course project report or we are project report about this we are active in the format will be shared well in advance the evaluation rubrics for we are also will be shared well in advance so all all the formats and all all the necessary details for participants will be shared bellini but what is important is the former team they decide on a topic and create a moodle course on all these oh years are going to be peer evaluate participants will get two weeks to prepare the weir and another two weeks to evaluate others we are how to handle logistics team should be formed before twenty fourth may two thousand it and this is where we require the course coordinators help now the course coordinator has to collect gather the team details from their remote center and submit to us by twenty fourth may two thousand etc only these people will be eligible to participate the we are active and we are is a mandatory activity for this particular episode because is the most critical or activity that everyone build one more a important point we have a zero tolerance policy regarding plagiarism are inef dippy one zone unfortunately there have been many instances of plagiarism specifically in resource creation assignment where people have copied each others somebody has used their peers course journal report and uploaded it it may have happened in a mystic also there are cases where they wrongly uploaded the same a file so they looked into the other one an prepared a new one but unfortunately they uploaded the same file that are created and the rabbi also instances in asia too were the moodle course the name was just changed and the course just remains the same oh this is not at all acceptable these were found out by our core stage when they were evaluating the artsy grievances or when they were looking at a looking at the core journals from several participants what we are going to do is we are going to put all the core journals and all the submissions to turnitin and we are going to check for plagiarism if he found plagiarized you will not be eligible for if dtype certificates even though are the participants will not be eligible for a nifty certificate even though how much if coden assimilation quiz reflection quiz or the knowledge base we have been a there is one more reason for this all the resources that you are creating there are going into a pool of open educational resources that itee bombay is going to dedicate to all are to the nation in will have a common access page where all these resources could be i will be aggregated and can be accessed from so it is important for us thus to ensure that these resources are plagiarism free and all the participants had indicated a provided consent for plagiarism check when they start the course so indefinite itself at the time of registration also all these resources are going to be in creative commons all the resources so if there is a plagiarism we are going to do that is one thing that we have strongly emphasized a pros of attack had also mentioned academic ethics and integrity it is very important as teachers we are also a we are also what do you see a role models for our students now if we indulge in practice look at how many or how many of our students are going to learn from that is why anti bombay is very strict on this policy we do not mind that you you put in an effort didnt achieve a do well into certain standards that we had look adamancy our standards are also not so look at the evaluation rubrics should evaluation rubrics are given well in advance to all participants so that they can understand what is expected from soy or it is also expected to when we show this much faith in a day to all participants it is also expected that a participants repay the faith by not indulging in such practices it is completely in admissible so as course creditors you will have to soak them so whenever we find a plagiarist a content will be informing the participants keeping the course coordinators and blue so all the pleasure a plagiarism complains we will be taking strict action soup any mistake from the participant it is not expected anything please ask the participants to be very careful when they upload digital artifacts any kind of technical error is a hub from their end is not accepted acceptable for the afc even for and even for the efv dippy one gyro one wherever we have found these unfortunate cases of lets a file being changed we do not have any other way with us we had to actually sew both the m in both the people would be a a impacted so suppose somebody refers a somebody elses oblige a artifact and create their own and we see that the plagiarism has happened a year so it will show me a report which says that this is these two are plagiarized so both the people would be impacted and ideally we would want all faculty to go through this if the peace and be eligible for being future coordinators in our blended of ixia looking to build a community were empowered who are aware of the court consequences and a be responsible so it is important that all of you arm a ensure that all participants please ask your participants to a completely stay away from legends or copying from each other cause it is creating a wrong precedence it is absolutely a mean in terms of what the chain off the chain that goes forward this is also not giving the right message to your learners you the students so of this is all about the arm if dtype two zero one and these are the main things that i wanted to share with you a before the start of the course so there are some questions that have come up alvis soon interacting with each one of a few of the remote centers are there are questions are from oak are regarding sharing of the a document i enable ll allow sharing are now so all participants can download a thus a slides at their local centers so i marked it as complete see somebody wants another arm abu testing session i will inform the studio team will have the testing sessions tomorrow so you can join tomorrow for the testing the testing slots are between ten to twelve somebody has an issue with video so all the technical issues i have the studio team for the studio team will be doing testing from mourning are ten a clock till twelve clock at tomorrow you can share it with a man carried with them so that the question in the chart can be do the eff deep in june and fortunately no because se they ft arm being in a blended format or you can do the online component from everywhere anywhere it is only the interaction component for which you have to be indie artsy so weird where giving sufficient flexibility for all instructors to be a part of the app so you can opt out of the egf dippy altar because will be having a flippy tucillo one reruns as well so you can decide the appropriate agency a there are lot of far remote centers across the country were connected to at home and we are the unfortunate issue is the calendars academic calendars of all universities are different so we are not able to find a unique time at which we can get all faculty are having a break so will have to stick with ones schedule and a hope that most faculty will get benefited out of form this particular offerings waddle doo nervous ah i do ab a interaction with a all are sees a what i do is ill clear all the sand clearing all the huntresses now so all arm menars is a major a all the archives or the coordinators who have patience can do a hundred now oil do i come visit your are seed a synchronously and ile a interact with you and all the coordinators please listen to the questions posed by other office if you have a same question ill be addressing we can get a redressal through these op through my reply okay so first i will go to a horsey horsey one three six four one three six four geethanjali institute a gitanjali institute i am unable to view your video or a arcy one three six four am unable to view your raw video apps make sure that you have your raw dashcam video check and you can do a handris again now it does or see one one zero eight a horsey patel institute of technology sherpa bullett proff the mike slightly away from your raw yeah thats fine or in peaceful unity than seventeen if even zeorymer enthused one has been run yes but my primary institute seminar participants are then gently behemoth finish to zidane oak finish only okay then automatically enroll in this tuesday in exchange they have to end on a good question so the question from arci won one a zero aid bhai patel a is that there were a few participants in that particular urzi who were unable to complete if dippy too a last year when we had offered so will they be eligible for or participating in a depth to this time the answer is yes so any participant also the idea of hefty one and two is that any participant who have completed one will be able to take up any future iterations of the same course now the only thing over here is that arm a the a participants have given a registration money of thousand rupees for both the a if dips now as a nazi army would request you to accommodate these people are with a body shape with their previous years payments if they paid previous year a pleasan amminadab the previous year we had given the payment so we would request the oas see to a take that as a payment and make them allow them to participate in this arm so that was a thats all observe any other queries easily open mic in attendance for a can you while putting an attendance from our side it is no you are you have two options so you have a dashboard where you can manually take the attendance right with that is going on in that process is going on yes yeah at least some part of manual yossie we cannot have body shape unfortunately grad have od hurling the attendance or other things for these kind of a disease so at least that is also one reason we have course coordinators and that is why we talk of blended moocs sudha should be some responsibilities at the local institute that needs to be a taken a taken up and needs the course coordinator that is why we have a course coordinator certificate or as a support staff also gets a certificate remote center coordinator also gets a certificate so there is to be some amount of effort to be done by each three of these people as well right yeah yeah yeah i had completed the soybean sixteen okay maybe three okay ah so this is a question regarding if dtype threes rowan now a psy op all the dips are part of a same program and any participant who has completed or if the op either into thousand sixteen or into thousand seventeen app will automatically be eligible for debbie three that is how the designers for the initial offering of depot three but we are trying to since this is the pilot offering we also want to try the new content so we also want to try out to see what is happening how effective visit etc so for the initial offering alone we are putting it in an invitation only where will be inviting a participants were scored more than eighty per cent in those apps so if dtype won a evto combined from the last year and a since into thousand sixteen we had only single depot it is at a percentage of that one full left so if you scored more than eighty percent if dara participants if they are course coordinators a amongst you who have scored more than eighty per cent a inevitable neither into thousand sixteen or into the assembly that is combined if dtype oneplus have dipped too you will be invited for this if deepika invitation is going to come soon ciber but unfortunately we have a very tight last date of main tent for registration so ensure that are you a complete a you do the registration by the time and this is a paid up or this is a sustainable model of dba you may not be required for a nazi also soak up the details are going to come out tomorrow to all i invited participants the brochure and other things are going to come to all the invited party okay thank you so let me now go to or see one one three five eight six one one three five man can you can you kindly move the mike slightly away from your failure that would be great see op question is regarding the payment for if deployed two or four participants were completed in the previous were unable to complete the previous offering now a in all ideal case what if it is a request to the arsinoe the arsi can decide how they want to take in the participant a biat paid thousand rupees per participant a in the previous offering of the afc so you can consider that as a payment and you can accept them or in equity to zero or if darcy decides that i have to pay all participants have to pay regardless of whether they completed or not we will not be so it is completely up to the artsy to decide whether you want to have a payment or whether you dont need to have a pin it is only a humble request from hours ride that if the participant a has been a coup if the participant has attended a flippy one in the previous year and he was not qualified for debbie to consider them as they are the payment that weird meet last year as a payment from a for the current year also yes so yeah so even if you want if you want to give concession please god i mean will be happy that you are giving a concession to the participants it is up to the arcy we are not giving any directive so it is completely up to the arsee whether you want to take payment or not yeah arcy one three eight seven a lucky ready college you would if you fuck yeah that is why i began to receive the certificates i wish everyone at one mandy and hong kong the registration for every big unexplained if its okay so um yeah okay a pertinent question from a fwd arcy one three seven the first question was regarding certificates the second question is regarding registration for debbie to now offer rob regarding the certificates of deposit one or we will be completing all the grievance redressal by tomorrow so once everything is completed and will have a plagiarism checks it will take us around ten days to complete the plagiarism check for aca journal so immediately after that the certificates will be dispatched now if a participant has qualified and has has been found to be a in the plagiarism list unfortunately will have to withhold the certificate okay so ah that is one thing so you can expect summer so wheel start dispatching certificates from around me tenth mittens to twelfth from our end for a baby one zero one two zero one certificate will take a month for us to complete the entire plagiarism checkers to where submissions are going to happen after a during zoom and there is going to be pure evaluation june also the course will be open but there are no good they are not going to be instructed with solely the evaluation activity and other things or it will take us roughly twenty to thirty days to complete the plagiarism check for empty too so am hoping that by july or july second week i will be able to despatch are every bit of a certificate then the registration receipts okay now this season so are the second question was regarding registration for debbie to zillow one now if dtype user one registration is going to be automatic or wheel enroll all the participants were successfully completed after a one a bun into evter and an invitation email will be sent to all these participants successfully qualified participants and this invitation email you can expect on wednesday second may harm a because we have a string of holidays on monday and tuesday thirtieth and first or holidays central government holidays so a will be a two wheel complete the grading a freezing the grading by tomorrow and on wednesday wheel move everyone into the eff dippy too course and will be sending an invitation link to everyone so by february second evening all participants should receive an invitation email and you think is a huge okay ah there is only one more ar see who is having a query this sassy one three one six dronacharya engineering college i yes good afternoon sue grafton is a spiritually we healthy university exam starting on it will meet till twenty six me okay would you most of the facility will be busy in the exam duty okay who believe we consider it properly reschedule of the deeps ah okay so again the same issue so this is regarding arm again this is regarding so are you talking of the abu sessions or are you talking of dip as a whole review obsessions okay now are in a mom one problem so the question is there are certain activities happening at a university level or at some level where the faculty are unable to come for the abu sessions on specific dates are unfortunately will not be able to reschedule debut dates because they are going to be slot clashes one way or the other heavy forwarded some other university will have the same problem so the alternate is what so if you actually look into the methodology that abused this time around what we asked all participants as we have asked for a summary report base after viewing the arm recorded interactions that we had a put up in youtube so i suppose some faculty does not attend the review sessions on either sixteenth and seventeenth or on norm twenties a twelfth and thirteenth as well as on twenty six and twenty seventh or the alternate is that they could do the activity within the ask the lab activity inside the artsy along with the others now we have given you the activity well in advance this time around we are giving it more than twelve to thirteen days fourteen days in advance so they could prepare for this the only thing is the topic the topic will be unfortunately will have to give it only on twelve so once the topic is given what they can do is again our youtube streaming will be available and we will be uploading this in our youtube channel all the faculty participants who are unable to attend the synchronous sessions can watch this youtube recordings interact with other horses the participants and get an idea of what happened and prepare a summary report okay so this summary report this needs to be uploaded in a as an alternate to their attendants thank you so or if there are any more queries so i see that many most of the queries in the chart has been crushed so westerns okay ah arcy one four two zero again a similar question on mate well there is a karnataka assembly election i understand that so as an alternate what you can try to do is arm watch the youtube videos do the summary activity and see how many of you can actually take part in the breakout session the very next day this time around if they are seized so i believe many of the arses within karnataka will have this issue and meet well what will all those horses who have problem intimate does well in advance to us so that we can schedule an ebu breakout session for all of you separately okay so will try to re schedule a breakout session for all of you on a convenient date and convenient alternate within this one month period so i hope i have addressed but it is important that all the faculty participants prepare a summary report and send it to outreach so the youtube channel link it is a just go to youtube and type studio eighty bombay you will see our channel so all those people who are having issues with the scheduling i hope ive addressed your raw western okafor raw people were submitted course reviews after due date unfortunately will not be able to accept those submissions because ce in a large exercise like this it is important that we are strict a keep berry a vicky berry ah so we have given relaxationi if on the review dates also so if given sufficient time for each faculty which not that gave us them to a do a review on one day and a submit or view the very next day only for few a ave you breakout sessions were that it didnt come over on one day we had this issue where they had to us or submit a review report the very next day but for all other cases were given sufficient time for all participants so it is important that the due dates be that is one reason we have these duties and we are in well in advance we are telling you the due dates there giving you sufficient time and it is flexible so that is why a due dates are important a okay the question from arci one four two two one one four what to do aa it is is the registration process process subject to approval from arci coordinator know it is not a it is an automated process you have already approved these participants in the previous episode will be directly moving them into the new a fwd and just check whether there are any okay there are few more raw colleges web dana hand race so this arcy one one seven six one one seven jeans hello yeah good put up the question is yes please guide the ebu has different interface for presenter and the viewer okay so yeah regarding breakout session one of the horse it becomes a presenter yes as of such now we dont know the presenter interface of a view okay so how could how could this could be bridge a like any r she becomes a presenter so he has to know the different interfaces that ivy has a show for example myself doesnt know the presently i interface so the break in in breakout session it would be difficult or a yes i completely understand so the issue is regarding how to make a few sessions more effective with the constraint that most arcy coordinators or the course coordinators may not be very much familiar with a view presenter interface they may have used a view as a client or they were the viewers as out there are lot more functionality is in the presenter interface are okay so artsy one one seven six saw question number one ah were there any if dtype participants from your wrap up your college during the last year were mentors ian yeah beware you were the mentors right so we had given a nano i was not a winter officially i was the interactor oak you are but whether mentors from your rock a college a new sofa or sees up all the course coordinators who have deeply mentors or top performers from two thousan sixteen in your college or the easiest solutions please contact these ab debbie top performers cuz they have utilized a view as a um what is a presenter adam what evil erik asu oil check with the studio team if they can have a demo session as a presenter before adi actually abu session maybe on the saturday itself the classrooms that has been alloted if you could do up a twenty to thirty minutes test session only the course coordinator with other horses as a presenter were each one of you do up a presenter trial i think will that solve the problem definitely okay so what will do us ah will set up the classrooms yes correct so what we are going to do his will create a meal video on the presenter interface and will are uploaded along with that will give your classroom where you are a presenter amanda will be other participants were typically your classroom youll be a present so are so evil you can view the video and learned the things and actually practice it when you are given the presenter slot yeah yeah ank you very much a year now and thanks for bringing this up i hope all other raw or sees a hab listen to it i have the studio team fits goldwell logistic exercise while have a studio team and workshop team work out the logistics of it okay so ill let you know about this activity in a weeks time when kiffin yeah okay thank you thank you sir are se one one three one ball chains graph noone knew neither do whose would need a multi year epic earlier would is to be done during the lab isnt well in advance we were under the practice effectively and the party participants will also get benefited we will also trigger local mentor to guide the individual participant requests to a provider lan activity detail en adwords audit yazoo the lab activity details is already there in the slide so it is only the topics that require more raw a thought so that will be intimated in a weeks time so if you check the slides ordeal so the question is about details about the lab activity so the lab activity and breakout sessions are the details are already provide further be five topics as a institute as a nazi you will have to create in class and out of class activities for flip classroom on those five topics first will do out of class because of us we start with out of class activities than in the second interaction you do in class activities where you learn more about the pedagogy okay so the exact topic details we let you know in advance all the gods bernardez will let you know in advance a thesis or see one four zero seven army institute pune memeo not audible or can you check your mike no not audible map and check your mike please check the audio out from the mixer has it gone correctly to the abc system okay army should worldviews i just go to another remote center you can post the question the question tab ill be addressing it over there okay yeah arcy one two zero one two nine two southern institute loosen hello there i would like to know the entire tenure of empire newsroom annex so the tenure of mythos sirte first okay and one more thing as you mentioned that will be going for empty three as well yes so what will be the tentative timing of empty three or so there is little premature to say the spa but the debbie third will actually be around may seventeenth will start around may seventeenth for twenty third are the brochure is being prepared will have to look at logistics but one thing from a one thing that is going to be different enough dippy threes that they are not going to be weakened interactions will be keeping office hours so participants can either individually look at the office hours from our youtube stream or they can as an ar see if there are lot of a participants in a bbc three from a nazi they can use the ebu facility within the aussy to actually connect to our arm off if dtype three classroom error case if you hit that impede zero monarchs an a be tree will be going on simultaneously as you mentioning the deed every seventh yes yes so but if debbie three is only for those people who have successfully qualified if dip one end of depth to the previous iterations for the participants will be different okay thank you so much easier and down one clarification regarding womanhood our tenure so the instructions will be from may three to thirty one of the owners of patients will happen somewhere around mid june or the sec a first week of june another be evaluations happening during the third week of june and usa and it is good that as you mentioned that you be checking out the academic calendars of different universities attend schedule this empty ones zero minutes at a more conducive timeslot in the coming time because i felt as artsy coordinator that menu to faculties couldnt follow because of their hectic routine and wish to complete it successfully but they were literally struggling with the time i completely understand oh yeah so the same one thing is that marketing that we have known right now is that if dtype won zero one can now be given as a self paced course for most of the faculty so the next offering of aberdyfi won zero won the may have a self paced course are also so that faculty can take it up at their own convenience and do the activities only things that peer evaluation has to be synchronized so theyll have to give appropriate will have to work out some mechanism

there is little were they not pass not pass their yasso not muslims no certificate okay those work orders are passed by default they will be logged into the empty be bart muni rover yes yes okay as one more thing is what about a baby bath three which were talking right now so let me know their hefty three is for raw so once again for the benefit of all horses if dtype threes for past if dtype successful participants are any participant who has scored more than eighty per cent in our previous if the piece will be ah a ah oh tomatically invited to a hefty three now for ra a if it is a two part course if dtype oneplus debbie two marks will be used that should be greater than eighty percent this is just not the pilot offering but the result of debbie to etiquette will declare later on in june and also this this is a hefty three is for participants in the previous years if dtype won and to not for the current if dtype won in two parts so theyll get there a little three chance later kiddo with usually two zero one seven one seven and won six we had two in the last two years we have conducted similar heft okay energy loans entering every monsoon was protected you are correct so all those people who have scored more than eighty per cent in aberdyfi oneplus to come by will get that certificate so we have to invite them on the meal all sums that will be harder to be so the invitation email will be sent from e outreach to all those parts okay thank you very much a this arcy one zero one six kesey somaya mumbai allow a mimio not audible can you check your mike hello any edible yes please boy took it a my question is are those who have registered for a baby one zero one two thousandth seventy have thier day yes now if they went to register for choosing a home what is the procedure the deer to fenu unfortunately it is not possible so it is like you doing a who have completed be tech first year re enrolling for a be tech first year course again if a teaser on monday completed one man and not even register okay sorry sorry sorry or that will be o to their being auto enrolled into a depot two zero one and theyll get an email from outreach he even the people who have completed manjiro won in two dozen seventeen yes all of them will be getting an email from so are the updated user one is a automated enrollment so all those participants who have successfully completed any of the of dippy one in the previous years will automatically be invited for that if dtype to zero so they just have to accept the invitation when he outreach sense hooks and chip shop a this is artsy one three three one berlin shoot of technology ranchi vadivelu will be a very similar question what last years us weekly like morrison interested it had cleared the api one hero one act play where he ends the kenefick require people litter on the issue a directly regarding the permission letter a i dont think it is required because you have submitted a permission letter in the previous year so it is only a clarification as regarding i hope that theyll be able to attend the ebu interactions that is happening on the weekends the rule still applies if they have to attend all the abuse issue in question that someone is to discontinue their involvement in other year so this really process so also the question is regarding suppose there is a faculty who due to their academic load or other activities is unable to take up if dtype two zero one is there a separate process thus far and enrolling there are no separate processes for on enrolling they dont have to look at activities they dont have to do the activities it is completely up to them so if they are not accessing the course we will automatically consider them to be ah unenroll should do not worry about it the last time i had absorbed into the swing votes yeah i think that woods we are at with theory we are near a roaming the galaxy a but let it alone it with a copy of it it surely we are a dick pumped team of board members if officials are not covered like other members are not in the area that one oh okay so if detai are this is regarding doubt regarding we are activity where activity is a group activity so what is important as that term within a remote center or the participant as far as possible try to adjust on a common topic okay if nothing works out let us know in advance now if you tell us on twenty third that i can get a team it will be highly impossible for us to a search for a new team member or do other things so arm one more additional thing us at least a ten days before the due date that is at at least immediately after the first interaction fourth or fifth if participants check and identify that there are no suitable to team members will be able to help you out in identifying new team members from across the oasis and recreation interaction is on well meant six knee ethically discussing the pipe of exactly one help me out the outer plus recruitment in the other is classic correct but what we focus this year a asa i would request you to hold the mike a steady so the app because you voices breaking at some point but i understood the question the question is are there any focus a questions are focused topics yes there will be focused questions and focus topics for the interactions we will intimate each course coordinator are this by next week this particular session was to tell you that this is how it is going to be derby a initial lab session where each other be five topic for which the entire aa she has to create out of class and in class activities together so based on the number of people within the hours you can select a other topic that you want at a tea cup and the present are the details of the topics and the details of evaluation etc will be given to each course coordinator or by arm next week as soon as the course starts byron fourth or fifth will be able to email you the course topics and detail instructions on what has to be dont we get why why were we would interrupt and begin on the web portal candidates are also gold so four interactions are important because a lady this course is about the pedagogic okay and the pedagogy requires much more finer a dead body shape interactions and the descriptions from each other so are the first part of the activity is about out of class activity how do you do the out of class activity you need to get feedback from other teams about out of class activity okay now this will take one full day and you also need to get instructor feedback pseudorabies peasant sessions regarding technology and regarding the flipped classroom activity or the a the rationale for these kind of a pedagogy courses so this is also you you will have effectively a almost a day of feedback from id bombay side and half day feedback from other horses that is why so you have to get the feedback for both out of class and in class there are two separate segment and that is why this is four a synchronous days and additionally if you look at it a the a if dip is a two week equivalent depth now in a two week ecolint ft arm each synchronous week is equivalent to lead to a one day worth instruction now for two weeks of debbie to ask for us to give your two week equivalent epc certificate it is important that we show fourteen days off or attend arm ten days of activity now this app is only for one month of instruction which means four days of instruction with four more days what we have a tsar a what you said a the four more days you get four plus for a days worth actual days which we can show a city that this is the amount of hours invested by the participant and for that we are that is actually the risk evaluation and creation that is counted as one full day each so creation takes one day evaluation takes one day so that counts up to ten days of physical activity which is fourteen days fourteen day debbie as weekend and thanks man yeah okay this arcy one one four six knowledge institute of technology a salem tamil nadu to rebut him yes absolute go at least give us a real yeah your asking are you telling about a plagiarism checker one of the slides and i have one question regarding that yeah visualization last hymn goes was run in the month of august till november a plagiarism check was done and some of our participants who never really done all the instructions included in all activities by themselves but one thing they did was likely use some of the former summer report content which were rashad in the format report had been eating a big steel gear so it was parliament that the reports were falling into plaigiarism chicken they were withheld the certification after which we were opposed to a standard email to the native be extreme and they responded with the actual content is okay and we will be not witholding edinburgh and will be giving certificates again ya so but that was the procedure which we underwent last him yasu agorism check drew heavily and we do have any mechanism to overcome this so to this particular activity is introspective and ensure that you cite the original format report for this is regarding a plagiarism check where it is taken from example report or somebody is previous evthe report to avoid complete plagiarism ensure that you cite these resources in your raw citation section that is the easiest way in which you can avoid the plagiarism issue yeah okay yeah lets move to chennai one more question yeah and that is regarding her if the petry okay and you told in one of a bill you told her some time ago that her appetite if deputy is going to start a around neath salty in the midsole in tamil nadu a most of the colleges have exams during the time and the most of the faculty with the illuminating auroville will be location so is it possible to convert a to start from the month of june so that the eligible participants will be able to pull pledged a okay so hard working folks are ready to answer this query again debbie three is a pure online course so it is completely up to the faculty when they engage in for there are no mandatory interactions per say in the month of may we are keeping office hours so if a faculty as a specific doubt they can so its not just a view that gears using youre using youtube also so they can actually view the aid office hours in a youtube our roar youtube studio studios youtube channel and they can ask clarify their questions from youtube itself are now the major involvement is required in a job as the earth in june where they have to facilitate interactions with their mentees and preparing the way how that is the place where there needs to be involved again that also we are giving them the flexibility of the medium of their choice so even if they have invigilation duty or even if they have any activity they can use any medium that they have to complete the ifp dip it is a pure online course or it starts on may seventeenth at it extends till end of june to facilitate all the activities in that particular course book is a rethinking ah so this arcy one four two two aces emmas harpoon yes please guides i am not able to hear your audio to check your mike yeah tell me you are alone that a freakin eric our birthday every year it will cover so the amount of thousand rupees for both the ifdefs so evthe too does nokia and at a separate office and a second question was like a due to some reason it not possible to add the olive widow i direct non given deal are hi anyhoo andy take though you are defeating the second and a baby in the next year as in a can you elaborate a bit although we never academic going on madigans are going on there who know if it is not possible for us to both do the heavy heavy re racking on saturdays sundays a month in the month of me okay then what is the possible see if the archive as a whole is not able to do that are been at sea be first alternate us see whether there are other horses were having issues on i suspected a unep diffeent to everyday yes so people who have successfully completed a fd one zero one ah will not be eligible for participating in this years if dtype won zero one okay but some of them have participated saddam volunteered and debbie how did that happen i mean again should be checking with the workshop team on how this has happened cuz that is not required they be by default be eligible for empty too why did they have to redo the boss but then again they have done the individual was adequate for the year in tip dip the tip so if they if they were eligible for the previous api so the only one way in which this could have happened is they would have registered using a different email addy in enemy a city deity bombax how in this case yes there will be able to do that now this is not fair i mean first of all this is not fair oh i would ask i would request the course coordinator to tell them the seriousness of the issue it is like i mean we dont have a problem in them doing the are everywhere but it becomes a logistical nightmare for us at our and when people use multiple email id is to register for this kind of courses so i mean in principle they can actually attend depee to zero and with even their last years if dtype won zero one op codes so the dems have to do anything dell be auto enroll now what theyre going to see is their first im a lady will get automatically invited by outreach and theyll get another invite in the current team melody with which they have actually done a dippy one zone a are not able to hear you sir can you check your raw audio yes as far as i know they were enrolled with the same im a lady with which they are enrolled for the previous activities this is highly unlikely but yeah i mean at least if you can get kindly contact outreach team ah a bidders list of participants amid see there is no problem there is no problem from a mind we just want to see how they missed our filter at our it because we had ensured that all the participants in previous two years of completed are we not do a repeat work the same thing yeah so i mean it is like new completing beaten going again to beat a first year class and doing a course and there is no point in it right i understand that learning a value but when why did you put so much effort that is the best year so please share the list with the he outraged okay arcy one month six month please note this thank you ah arcy one one four zero shastra university railings are and sushi killer yapp deeming them and the course coordinator noosa yeah are you just about a be tree yes hopefully i might be one of the participant cites me hopefully i hope that you have qualified for with greater than eighty percent in our previous if the piece into not one i did score about eat okay great so you will be invited dont worry he said so when i am undergoing that pose a riddle i continue to be the who spotted us absolutely there is there is no change in your current roles depi three is an independent of the ppi regardless of what happens in a deeply wounded too only thing is to qualify for dippy three you should have completed if dip one end of deputy ocation and old also told the duration is from me level till the end of june may seventeenth till end of june so that is the instruction durations will have to prepare reports and everything during that time there will be some minor materials each week so itll not be a heavy instructor led session it is more about facilities so there will be activities that you have to do that youll have to do a lot of creative activities will have to engage in discussions with your other course participants that will be more inept people its all about facilities okay yes him and my previous equip itself i did the passion my feelings about the sauce was truly a superb whose wish i undid the wen and anime this semester also continuing to use for my student interaction work great as helping heal helps me not to link my students the course and also to enable them to enjoy the benefits of online learning children have received a very good feedback from students also homeless rate great thank you and guide a must for this woods shot oh yeah if you are seeing one month or six six birla ant abdullah institute of technology youreplace guidi said good evening yes they are audible now kiss her i just wanted to ask you one there are some participate in faculty participants who are doing the course and at that time our center was undergoing its own academic semester the big bang and some problems not even though i could complete the assignments are tegan as zero do even then it has a vision lines for submission submitting their assignments so if there is if there are some doors that you cannot win as a second round to them they are eager now because theyre a vacation starting up week yes they should be part of academic ethics learning continuous learning ethics there should be given chance yes another gum so okay so are the question is regarding arm in the current of debbie unfortuanately due to logistics schedules will not be able to take up a submissions again but what we are telling you is that this deeply worn and if depot two courses are going to run again and again so if them are taken up debbie one ones will be eligible for are redoing it next time for their efforts will be very less compared to what theyve done this time out so will try to look at schedules across the country and will set up if delivered at convenient a form in a self paced format that is what we are actually looking at the problem is we had already completed the assignment submitted also but still there names coming indie category of the qualified candidate or because of some baby because even i being my go to summit one released in a mailbox but because of the delayed response is inevitably i will be to be participants i could not summon these submissions i could not be accepted from your end in pipeline a bad reasons yeah i understand it though the course coordinator submission it had only been a minor battle so if you actually look at it be lab assignment we had a for everything we had an alternate so if it was two lab assignments one of them was done by the participant neither by the remote center a coordinator soap everywhere weird given the choice and deft the participant has not qualified it means that they are not a disease successfully completed or taken up the skills that were essential from a ftp event sudan yemen do not worry theyll get a chance to redo the eff dippy one in a more sincere and more dedicated manner we are working towards a that at the moment and regarding mixtape dvd is the month of me as one of the previous nazi slowly having seen eagerly on vacations or debian we ask invigilation duty saw amin cookie i heard your response we will be trying artist that are qualified candidates are able to do the group activity watching what you want your submit submit your submissions in times is the breakout activity can be performed in other aspects so say the photos used on the breakout activity avenue ensure that the breakout activity habits and da your liberal this time also eagles and with caesar and then redoing a physicians is again and not possible for every faculty are involved not involved in teaching here involved in adell tashlich research what nut hugging that load so after the meal as a mom you hope you are the ones your mom you hope you understand that we are also involved in a multitude of activities other than epididymis ourselves so we have an entire team who are required to do a multitude of activities at our end and said a beer giving you sufficient relaxation season we are putting up these things in youtube or be are encouraging you to do the summary in view them in youtube but only thing that we are asking you to do is accuse the breakout sessions together seem we are trying to accommodate as maximum as possible and this is a very skilled effort it is not it is not just two or three remote centers that we are catering to me have a total of hundred thirteen remote centers in this particular if and when you are doing are things at scale it is important that me a stick to the deadlines we stick to the schedule because otherwise others are being unnecessarily put in the trouble but even with all these limitations we are trying our level best to be accommodative to be because this is a larger goal we understand that faculty have so its not that we do not know the issues on ground we understand that there is embe accreditation problem we understand that they are going to be other management related activities in house activities students doing this and that disciplinary issues and other things but see even with that but we are asking you is there is only a very minimum thing that we ask we are asking you to interact with each other because that is the only way ahead and say please and mia this time around we are giving things much well in advance we are having a session with all course coordinators telling them this is what is going to happen we are informing you what topics are your informing you how the activities will be done now how much more liberal can we be mom ya see regarding registrations we should consider digital candidates are qualified your woodwind yes they devoted no no no formal proceedings no formal procedures but nope approval or any other kind of things you can access to the one content directly on each guests yes adelgid an email from me outreach just ask them to click the link that said yeah i have registered in the course after ten days and i found that i found that there was a problem the higher the bump itself and after the start of course we are registered after ten days puppet still we did our assignments and i have submitted my book the ascendant duple time okay going okay so i have not submitted what is the reason i will not attend i will no go for the course again because in spite of my submission it is showing that not to mention the word means what about these problems actually mine was already in problem and i could register after ten days i was able to access my course of a delicately from figures of technical difficulty there itself was okay so even if it is okay or if it is a technical issue from our end ill make sure that it gets addressed a immediately even if you are having if you are seeing that it is not submitted or the only issue that i can expect to happiness they might be a net connectivity issue at the time of your submission but i check what has happened at the backend ah have you seen your grades for these activities have you been graded for the submissions they should have seen and there is no greedy it is showing that i have not submitted but i am hundred percent have amill you during the in their technical problems which are limited each of these activities are seen on a nazi to whom it is showing that are not submitting okay i give i mean ive given the meal to the core support also broken the one feedback also i have submitted but again no action has been taken till its okay dont worry ruby she heads through me she had submitted the meal but okay sponsored aright from that if it is possi ble isle i look at this case i look into this case your case personally and i will ensure that appropriate actions are being taken to address your issue okay youll receive a mail from ink in couple of days gimme a couple of days to actually understand the issue well email back to work if you are about the name of a what do you use a word the name audio naeem sunita suni itchy nominee sunitha icity sunita please noted down is now in its indian monuments etc one monkey sunitha soon okay grit so oil are dont worry as sunita mom i have a look at what exactly happened and ill personally or reply to gary rinky will mix up ah yes your harley won for zero article yes your audible yes okay so the kids and good afternoon so i took a couple of questions that eleazar eptfe i eat you told that i attribute to your own water and old so what is the post qualifying marks last time i complete it would be gone and a bit too and it is about ninety per cent arriving but are these time lusting her what happened was there at the pass mark was a thirty five percent so your talking ab auto enrollment what is the qualifying much distinct okay what i mean all those if deeply participants were successfully completed a debbie what a fifty per cent this year will be qualified to ah if debby are two auto nto day debbie auto enroll so not least the victims and so last time it was happened earlier it was less than reputable that was because they were there were issues in the questions as well as in the logistics of there were some issues which we had to accommodate that is why we had reduced to forty percent not certify person what a person to person and what is a district with maintenance but he will be their ineptitude so yeah it depends so commitment urgency will be there but only for the open education resources so they will be a mentor for a helping out the participants in a we are creation and the other activities it does itll be based on epc with rizzo are the mentors will be from debbie three so that is how we have war arm array that is why an overlap comes one eggs there will be interpretive introduction or not are we are there need not be aview interactions they can decide on the mode of interactions themselves so who will be the minute you decide it gambill recite or archival dissect a ighty bombs so they will be all the debbie three participants so be that is why we are creating an if dtype three course it is specifically for mentoring okay so theyll be coming from some okay and one thing is actually easier to tune the digital self sustained course and buttercup jars inn in west bengal most of the participant from the earth itself last time what are the hurdles to us we are from halloween so technology my r she was two hundred kilometres away from my college okay right now now we hear darcy mortgage rate yeah so what is happening all participant from r see itself as the enemy city mission is te to tenthousand tejas year and it is a self sustained course also and how the remotes into suppose in west bengal to remote centers now yeah i years a man may look okay so even we struggle how many teachers satire if it is a self sustained good priests rething on eat and if the fees may be removed from the participant and or money means may be provided by the government that libet was because what i feel i went to the kolkata means that is too hundred kilometre stay at hotel or somewhere else it is really a challenging what i feel personal feel dont i might not comparing tea i iit bombay and what what what i try to ask if hes there he hastily estimated what theyre willing to if they personally dust suppose icon to learn i can learn it otherwise if there is the personal interests if is there in a city mandate or rules okay who is the faculty of the engineering or engineering a city approved colleges deny they have to complete the epdp andrea divito like be a dirty a lead in primary and high secondary education so this is there in the end it is a demand it or not a so there are no specific mandates op at the present time we are but as it has approved these courses we are working towards need a job to make this a mandate and other things there are multiple hurdles if a policy change right and i to bombay alone cannot do this that us yes we are trying we are pushing for some changes at our end but it will take some time and also regarding the funds and other things we are also seen a if there were sufficient funds at our end we would have completely wiped off the participant fees because we understand the importance of these courses to faculty but say there is also a counter fact o are that we have to understand there have been cases where many other faculty may not be from your remote centers or may not be from any of the up a remote centers were participating right now were not taken these very seriously because it is a free course they do it at their own a flexibility then they ask for a charming produces a extensions considering their case there are lot of these are requests and other things that are coming in and one day one thing that we are seen as the moment meat put up a cozy even now we say that thousand rupees for a faculty for two courses is not a high amount it is actually a slightly what is a fiand rupees per course if action look at splitted by a course by course now that is a very small amount a aiming find rupees for a four week course by any standards by the as per the current pay standards also its not a huge amount for a faculty even i can understand if a student completes but if a faculty says that i cannot invest find rupees for one course that is slightly i mean we have we are trying to accommodate moves and this thousand rupees or is only for the artsy maybe item is not taking a single penny from any of the faculty we are actually inviting more faculty to come in but since horses are providing the services they also need to be renewed but that is why we are looking at the sustained mood self sustained sofa if ars is able to accept any person without a beaver then we are happy we are also more happy that are more or seas are willing to do this now my question is when it is free there should be compulsory so when it is when it is free only because it is free that should be compulsory there is no chance to take it lightly but unfortunately that happens right rules you usually better knowing faculty mindset than me he had never know what we believe the partition most of the participants from the aa season so see you on some horses are so ill tell you an example i think it was emmas college who is also participating are seed this time ah whatev donors they have given a twenty percentage deaf kept four people coming from other horses and the moment eighty percentage of their seats get filled they will not allow any participant from there are sea to a register for the courts now are at or sea level they should take innovative strategies like this so that others will also be benefited you others will also know and one more thing is that we are increasing the number of remote centers now so the more people get a listen to these attend these sessions you will have more remote centers and that will also help us in scheduling these kind of activities in a more effective manner in future let so unfortunately the only political party should investment year haso the intention the mission anyway citizen heard victims will be okay tankage occasional very much and will have received no from no prob yeah so this is asking one zero six five phenolics academy hello hello are not audible saw a not audible ah can you check a ah oh ah ill come back to you meanwhile check the audio settings i have one more or see or hear or see one to seven it yes deum institute thank you for patiently waiting till five thirty hello ah isdom institute vijay karnataka let me find out the question that you have posted oh yeah please god i was able to listen to you at some point of time ah yes deum institute are astm institute i am not able to hear you are ashamed should you have dont mentioned question you said that you have a question can you put that in the question again i am not able to hear you over here i also check the chat window to see whether a posted something over there a please make sure that you post it in now the question staff put the question in the questions that i am looking at that time right now meanwhile lyle go to a another artsy one four four seven bimal jyoti op thank you for seeing college aggregation and janet young earth once a person goingion endemic michael snaer said i have completed their first and second of every businessman and dynamic he sensed the need and eminem is argentinian here okay here enough to be two years have we reached a maintained seven nine french feminine here every bit as it once again we will be a really addicting deepak the mundane everyday again so the question is are they the participant was god only seventy nine percent are inept dip one end to combined together are unfortunately for this offering will not be able to accommodate him but see this offering is a pilot offering for us to understand how if dtype threes are received by all faculty okay so we had to draw line they drew a line at eighty per cent ah i mean when we had to draw live and we know that the moment we draw a line that will be someone who is close to the line we sought to the other side of the light i will not be able to accommodate anyone at this point but in future but we are going to do is once we see the effectiveness of hefty three will ensure that all people who have qualified for a hefty one and two come into a fwd car that is the larger aim that we have across the next or to three years will be working on that okay getting this year i am just now looking into the question a look in the chat chat chat a isdom institute i hope you have put that in the chat okay so i see a in a few days and in either by tomorrow evening that is when the thing so we are having some are testing some functionality is at our end once the test is completed an email will be sent to paul i hope i have answered most of the queries that have come up so regarding registration additional content questions question staff yeah i think most of the questions have also been artisan up asks what will do is ill have a
