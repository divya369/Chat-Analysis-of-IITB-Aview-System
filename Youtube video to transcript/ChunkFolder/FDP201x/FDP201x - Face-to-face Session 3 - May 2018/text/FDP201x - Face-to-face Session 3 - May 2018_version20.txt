or a try to see if there are groups who could accommodate one more person a in dirty old dirty bit uneasy guess from other horses if nothing works out a if you are not able to get anyone till twentieth please inform us so that we could also talk to other course coordinators and try to put you in a particular team okay okay okay we did you tour participants so in exceptional in exceptional circumstances we would allow force oppor participants okay let me now go to are see one one four six knowledge institute of technology your archive and one for six emmy edible yes go luckily i raise my hand to give speed up the last two days yeah tell me please no problem but the thing is that yesterday weve done what we can we do have done it but the thing is that time sufficiency was remotely sexually this would we feel from acid okay but what does that activity what was the topic of which model activity adabas database database database urine which group creating a database at eden ati grouper group for a very able to participate in the breakout sessions i have you participated in breakout session the morning okay until you have done it and you presented it okay but i i hope that we havent done completely what are the things entirely details yarn given ethos yeah see ah that was never the see a complete mastery of a database activity was never the intention of this a particular exercise the exercise was that you will be able to so the rationale of this exercise was that you will be able to search for the information you will be able to find out necessary information collated synthesized and then create something new so this is what any new teacher would do suppose you have to so suppose you are given a new topic and asked to create a lecture tomorrow you will be doing the same thing right so this exercise was a simulation of that particular thing for you will know what to look for an ar todays activity when you get when you see what others have done what others have a a done for the same particular activity you will also get to know what they have also seen okay so this was only a exercise too exp a let you experience in terms of us as a student what active learning us and what active learning actually means so you as a learner as a learner you try to get information try to make sense of it and synthesized and this is what you are sure does and now you have given me an excellent feedback saying that you yourself are not satisfied with whatever you have done in terms of the synthesis i mean there is no better learning than what you have just said right now so the exercises meant to elicit that only okay so do not worry if even if you havent learnt fully but at least now you can be assured that you have the sufficient skill set to explore and make more out of it and this is what any facilitator should do any learner should do any teacher should thank you again okay let me now
