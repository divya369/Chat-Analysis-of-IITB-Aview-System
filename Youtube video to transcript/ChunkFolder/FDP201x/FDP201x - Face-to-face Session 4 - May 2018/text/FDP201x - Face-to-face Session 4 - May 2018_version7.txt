i net access pim college of engineering sindhudurg maharashtra are you not audible sir can you check your mike yeah please note even if we do have a given activity or workshop creation we have created workshop and waves use different assessment methods in that oak like rubrics also viewcreated oak and also we have ignored one another king dedede competency level oak grey competency level that data to a slowed know that good enough to put my suggestion is we are from mumbai university okay so for submission of tumour we normally you have we have the assignment writings on paper for experiments were to attack the printouts i guess okay so if if the mumbai university suggesting their syllabus only you have to were picked up a submissions or tumble submission through this model then that will be better so everywhere it will be company what your using slow change is slow yet we might more pasta ah i appreciate the suggestion that you have given but you know that mumbai university is also in the show because they did many of their assessments online but it is the eighth i am just joking say ah ah yes an institute we can always only recommend these kind of changes but if you have a lot of institutes under mumbai university who say that these kind of learning management system should be made activity in these kinds of learning management system should be made mandatory they should be standards then that is when the university will also look up and try to get sad get yours suggestions implemented in the policy say a policy wise if you actually look at our age it is they are encouraging online moocs etc even in the standard curriculum for students so you could add they are offering credit transfer from el pital of several universities are signing up memorandum of understanding with entitle for credit transfer for their students so this is actually slowly coming up so the moment a mumbai university sees that many other universities are taking this up these kind of a ledge avin a policies and practices a sure shot of going to be implemented or in your own system as well but see a policy is one thing which we do not have control of an it moves at its own pace there needs to be protocols the womens board meeting should be their syllabus revision or whatever committees have to be form need to understand the feasibility and at this juncture if you suggest something like this technology thing especially for evaluation of term work to mumbai university i am really doubtful whether they will actually listen to us at this moment but ya i will or i will definitely ask prosafe attack when he move goes to a meeting in mumbai university at least two or try to voice this opinion ah to the office officials over there so thats all what they do one thing i knew ya allow a because currently it is in film in sweden is going on for third year now would be from this academic year eighteen ninety lyrical film television in third year okay oh yeah so now you yeah we will try our level best at least to convince people or
