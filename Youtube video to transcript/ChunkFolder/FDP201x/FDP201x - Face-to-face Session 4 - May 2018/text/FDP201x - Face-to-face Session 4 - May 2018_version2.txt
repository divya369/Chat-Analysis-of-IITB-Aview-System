i am getting more information and are refining their understanding about the blogs so for example are an important thing as external blogs could be embedded too a moodle blogs by using a a external body shape are you a using the blog a button also so obvious are something that we have seen is that even if it is a small activity at the interaction between different darcys is very usefull and very yout a i mean its not aminu maybe knowing lots of things but there are many others who may not be do knowing these specific aspects of the model of a tools which they would be we only if they interact and one more important thing is the purpose of the session is for or cease to interact with each other now when there are seas were interacting with each other you could actually look for okay ah ah we have participants who are in individual domain or is there someone in the in your ar see who are from the same domain so that we could work together all these kinds of interaction is also possible but it wouldnt happen because none of the presenter who presented their top hurriedly on ended some of those unable to hear you cry and who are able you will come presented on the mobile phone it oh how we can see that on mobile phone when nothing is visible on the mobile home residents who buy do that yes i reaction was i printed the year so i completely agree i completely understand seem all the horses are getting used to this modality of working together see one thing that i want to exhort through this app is that its not a one way transmission in terms when you you actually use technology you need to collaborate you need to explore the various ways in which you can actually work with different technology applications such so that it can benefit you now this for this there are some a teething problems like okay aadhar interaction time ah there were technological issues there were some disturbances may be the presenter the presenter view was not given so we are also see we are also in the process of learning iety bombay as a central hub is also learning a lot of new things through these interactions and da it is through these interactions that we can evolve and we are working towards empowering all the teachers are in use utilizing a platforms like aview for arp conducting or facilitating a interactive sessions now if tomorrow if you want to let it so some of the cases that one faculty shared yesterday was that she has eight different domains of students are taking the same class so can they stream the same class using ave you abuse a free and open source software so they all they need to do is download the code or application and install in their system so if people know how to utilize aview effectively that is something that you can explore in your own teaching learning practice in the future and that is one important thing that is something that is embedded inside the activities that you do so any new issues that you face itself is a learning experience so any challenge so for example in your students case also it may so happen that sometimes things may not work fine but through these difficulties through these challenges that is the place where the learning becomes maxim and that is the message that we want to give a cross to all are seized through these
