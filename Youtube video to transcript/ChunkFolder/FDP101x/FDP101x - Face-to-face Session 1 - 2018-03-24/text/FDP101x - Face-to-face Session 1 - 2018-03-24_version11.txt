this may not be a remote center today but what is the remote center remote center is nothing but an institution which is connected using a view to some other hub today itee bob is a hub but there is no reason why one institution in kerala cannot be connected to five other institutions in kerala in tamil nadu or wherever they wish to soak you set for example i hope that they will use this to become a hub in the state of kerala where they could connect with maybe twenty by other institutions and actually conduct not just these training programs but even seminars workshops on various thing where instead of people having to travel to a single place they can actually participate creating this audio visual large virtual classroom so once again thank you so much coaching i offer this initiative and thank you all the students i notice that all of them a girl students so you are also representing the great women power of the nation i am also happy for that thank you so much can we now we can now interact with people we have still about half an hour so i thought i would request the remote centers if people have any question to ask on whatever were discussed today are in general about this please do a hand race i can see henrys coming there we go to another institution sent with said where is it located saint vincent college nagpur over to you yes yes your horrible your visible perfectly clear please go ahead is this a month or so i am hopeful that these small problems easily solved have shortly but i am happy that they are so many teachers participating from this college understand that you are a new remote center rail tell you theres over the last eight years that my colleague gave as southern dikshit has been establishing such reward centers with the help of his spread cheer his colleagues in the teammates it is often we find that first time in a center start interacting there are a large number of problems i notice that with your center as also with the cusat we did not have any hassles in reaching out to each other for example your perfectly visible your perfectly edible and understand that you can also see me and hear me i do not know whether i should attribute this to the better technology better bandwidth that is available or i should attribute this to more sincere technical efforts by your staff and thorough testing that is done by my team jointly with your team perhaps it is a combination of both any final comment that youd like to make over to you
