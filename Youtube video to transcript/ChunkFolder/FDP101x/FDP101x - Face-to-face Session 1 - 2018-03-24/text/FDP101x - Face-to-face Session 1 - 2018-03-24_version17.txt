so wouldnt that find the value of register and he has to do that manually but ter that student gave me one application where he was just given me the things that a madam instead of for doing it manually you can use this application for finding the value of register and that day i realize the students are motivating and using the technology very much so am little bit behind a that i was not knowing the application for that and by doing discourse i am excited that i will learn many things related to recordings developing website and many other things a so for that i would like to thank you and for morning station i got the solution for my problem or from many years i used to give the name as assignment one assignment to assignment three and if i want to find out anyone assignment i have to search fifteen or twenty files so for that i got today i got the solution so thank you for this thank you very much thank you for allowing for your observations other will correct observations a hope that all our republican colleagues are participating in this session would understand one very important thing which was obliquely that pallavi said that one of her students was able to point out an easier way of doing certain things and she commented that students seem to be ahead of her number one there is nothing to be ashamed of it any time period the students have always been smarter than teachers so all the teachers were participating and request you to go back in time when you were students did you not genuinely believe that was part of that your teachers are not talk about wisdom and intelligence but at our stores also believe the simple adspath retro the part which is true is that students of every generation get more earlier exposure to technology when theyre older so paloway youre speaking of your student let me tell you my own story i have a grandson who studies in its standard he lives in pune his team from millennium school got surprise in a competition and i was very surprised to know that youre actually doing arduino programming order programming is something which our embedded sources people do here and he asked me abba how do i connect this particular sensor what see plusplus statement do i use an eye to tell im sorry i dont know but when i studied i found out so you see the point is our source will know better which is okay just like the problem can be solved by someone else than me our fruits can also solve the problem i was again emphasize the importance of discussion forum please post such relevant information on discussion forum is acknowledge the person from whom you got the solution because i think that is a cutsy other trademarks and please keep your eyes and ears open because your students in all likelihood are more exposed to the technology at the current state of solutions that are available and as teachers at lucidity bombay we are absolutely absolutely no problem in learning perpetually from our phones after all what is the difference between stone said teacher both are learners teachers merely have more experience and probably bore qualification on paper but as far as learning is concerned as far as problem solving culture whether student or whether teacher or
