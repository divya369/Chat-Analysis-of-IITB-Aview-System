the point is that the size of a file determines what is the payload that gets attached for emails and what is the amount of storage that will require so let us imagine that you have a four megabyte a typical size of an image file if you want to store such thousand images in your desk youll require how much four thousand megabytes a thousand megabytes is known as a gigabyte thousand gigabytes known as a terror by these terms are important because typically the dish size that is available with normal desktops today is one terabyte class when i started working with the artist for the first type the main frame computer nineteen seventy four we had a russian machine garlicy ten thirty when a very large days it was a removable district could take the disc out and put another days the cost of the disk drive was five lakh rupees the cost of the hard disk was fifty thousand rupees at do you know the capacity of that hard disk it was seven point two five megabytes image a seven point to five megabytes that this could not contain even two digital photographs of today when clicked from your mobile or any camera we have traveled so much in the technology advancement and in its affordability that what used to cost fifty thousand rupees or it is with seven one to five megabytes capacity you can get multiple multi terabyte disks in that amount today and they all can be connected with your laptop or with your standard ever you call the web desktop and you therefore feel that youre not sort of story the unfortunate property of any story days is that it fills up eventually it is just like work expands to fill up available type data expands to fill up available space so even terabytes is perhaps not good enough thousand terabytes make one petaybee and the cloud that were created is of three petabytes storage capacity we believe that when we use it for putting all the digital assets we will have enough storage to at least capture the essential critically important and useful cultural information and knowledge information let me come back to the point that i was making that even though i chose the name of a file very carefully it is impossible to indicate all the relevant information about what is there inside that she was telling you about this example when we created the eminent personalities and as an example we were asked to create a site for sardar patel all of us know sardar patel we needed data when we designed the site we needed data so we decided that we will include every available information about sardar from various sources we got photograph we got images we got video clips record audio clips we got newspaper clippings but as i was telling you when we saw the newspaper clippings that were given to us by a southern museum which hosts all these data which had all these data and somebody when they gave us the days we suddenly discovered that in different directories that file files called scared three hundred and fourteen
