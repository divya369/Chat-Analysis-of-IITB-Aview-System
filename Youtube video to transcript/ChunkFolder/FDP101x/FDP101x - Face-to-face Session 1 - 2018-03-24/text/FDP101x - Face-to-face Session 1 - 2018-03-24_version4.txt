finally there is a default directory or a default folder which is associated with the utility that you do what is more important is when you want to say where the scanning utility will automatically give a default name to the fire so for example if users save my file as jpg jpeg file so it will create a name called scan zero zero one dot jpg is good enough please note that no computer can save a file without a name in extinction and therefore the name and extension is to be given buyers but if we dont give utilities will create their own default where often in a hurry we want to scan that page attach that file to a message to an email and send it to someone you are somebody in delhi or calcutta somewhere is waiting for the dog soldiers save that a scan zerozero watchdog jpg attached to email and send data unfortunately the receiver in kolkata will be receiving many such message imagine that that receiver has us above five hundred people to scan a specific kind of document giving information about themselves they say there are five wounded candidates and all these candidates are uploading their assigned biodata by scaring you are the one sitting in kolkata how would you lie if you get five hundred emails each one containing a file called scan zero zero one dog jpg it would make any sense and your life would become miserable what is the solution the solution is for example if i am scanning my signed bio data and trying to send that file to summer i should at least then that file as debbie phatak underscore biodata dot jpg the that this name convey or more to any reader this is why i say what is there a name as the right answer everything is there in the name has to be chosen very carefully for every file that you store whether you will remember such odd combination of names like can zero zero one and what do they represent is a different thing but others with whom you share that information with whom you share that i will not be able to understand automatic it is not always that you can put every relevant information about the content of a file in a single day as i said if i am scanning my biodata i can say debbie fortin underscore bio data now that convey some information but does it convey this bio data refers to which date in time for example if i submit a bio dita today ten years later again i have to submit my biodata and that file is again name debi further underscore by rita dot have jetpack or dot pedia whatever would people who have both these five sbe able to distinguish between which is an earlier file which is a later perhaps we could put a date or a year for example debbie fatigue fatigue underscore by rita underscore march two thousand deity will probably convey that the file was created in march two thousand native so most likely the bioreactor that the file contains in turn is up to date that unfortunately there are too many pieces of information which have to be associated with any content whether is a document whether it is a picture whether its a movie clip or whatever and whatever you do you can never write her thing our name which contains all relevant information about
