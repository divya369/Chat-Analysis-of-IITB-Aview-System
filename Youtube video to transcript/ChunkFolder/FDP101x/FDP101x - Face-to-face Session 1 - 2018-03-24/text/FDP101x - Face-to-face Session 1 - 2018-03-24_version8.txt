he casually to have standards on how to describe coins for example now you take a photograph of a coin or a physical coin with you the coin has two sides you might have to photograph but the coin also as inscription the coin has a date that coin is associated with a period of a king or someone who circulated that coin all of this can never be captured in the name of a file which is a something dot jpg he says is a photograph of a crime this metadata needs to be made part and parcel of the information that you store as i mentioned the library staff in all our institutions is probably the only set of qualified people who understand the importance of such material to appreciate what we lose when we dont have the relevant meta data consider this if you see this review session is being recorded after it is irritate it will be made available as a dot a before five when that file is uploaded with some name but a link is given to you on your i the bombay ics platform you will know from the context because it will appear as its a first interaction twenty fifth march you will know first interaction print when you click if you want to review some of the discussion that does happen you will see the entire video file there it is good as far as your kids what about somebody else who is not attending this course but wants to know what was said in an interaction who said it when it was said should you not think that there should be submitted if the debt should be created for a digital asset which is a video file do you not think that there should be submitted are created for even a quiz that you conduct you not think that there should be a meta data that should be created for a pdf document that is circulated as background reading material is understand that while giving meaningful name is absolutely essential it is not adequate we are creating an open educational resource repository in this cloud this repository lodge will happen as sometime in may this repository will contain all digital assets that we have created over the years for these and other faculty development programs including the online courses that we given songs hope you will immediately sense that by storing these assets even though these assets might have good filenames you will not be able to relate one acid vinegar acid when they were used in conjunction as a part of some course a whole lot of meta data standardization is happening as we speak i say allow this to you i say all of this to you because as teachers not necessarily involved in this kind of large collection and classification of information but as teachers you will be in hold always into thing number one interacting with your students giving them assignments collecting online assignments organizing those online assignments and have other tools which will permit you to give marks etc they may be spreadsheets you may be using google but you will invariably have a large amount of information contributed to by your students either as a part of assignments or submissions and unless youre very careful not only about the filenames used by your students you have also to be careful about the organisation of that information at least some metadata about every asset that is created
