ah yes all the participants should understand what was intended out of the activity but what is more important is within the classroom a no because even if they do not know they should use that opportunity to discuss about it in more detail now all of you are participants from all of your teachers from the same remote center a most of you as people who are from the same college they would know each other and their new participants also so this is exactly like your classroom so they are people there are groups who know each other really well there are some others who do a who are not it like a first day of classroom where lets say a lot of students come in some of them would be familiar with each other some of them would be a would be seeing some others for the first time but essentially all of them bring in some knowledge so letter all of the engineering students all of them with bring them bring with them some prior knowledge with the classroom with which they can discuss now as teachers each of us our idea or our ability should be to make sure that when all these people come together we make best use of that opportunity to make them discuss make them do activities together so that the collaborative collaboration among the among the learners would be higher now all that you need for to do that was lets you do an activity so a this activity sum is something that everyone knows creating a menu item in wordpress web page so this is like you give them some new i have a question or new activity based on their prior knowledge think of the first day in a classroom a all of you would have introduced yourself and after that teacher gives the first activity so the first activity would ideally be connected to rather than start of the a lesson so they would actually look at what are the prerequisites for the lesson and see whether they have the prerequisites right so to ensure the prerequisites lets say we give an activity within the classroom and beer utilizing that activity to ensure that people discuss and people are at the same level by the end of the activity and this is what we have done in our activity yesterday and there is no problems even if you are not able to complete the activity that was what is it that is not a problem for the instructor for the instructor what is important is that have you learnt how to do this activity more effectively so there are no minus points for not completing or are not submitting your wordpress web page there are no minus points for not coming up with a good plan of action there are no minus points for having a very a different wordpress web page the idea is having done that now when the instructor gives feedback today are you able to understand or are able to identify places where you need improvement are able to identify what you should do now to better or effectively do the same activity and this is all the purpose of this abuse sessions so we have a around hundred hundred and twenty remote centers are associated with us in this particular ifpi and for each aview session so we have a weekend debut session in this particular effort and in the next subject
