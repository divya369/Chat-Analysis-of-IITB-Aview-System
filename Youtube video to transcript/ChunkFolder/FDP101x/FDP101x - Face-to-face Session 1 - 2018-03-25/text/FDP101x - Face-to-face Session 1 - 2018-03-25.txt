the doubts regarding discussion forums how to navigate and discussion forums and how to do different activities are so yesterday we had conducted at the end of the day we had conducted a group activity session so this entire second half was devoted to a group activity session where they were given a scenario a scenario of arm a scenario of a large project like imperial approaching local institutions and asking them to a use entitle resources in a more effective disseminate a entitle resources in a more effective manner within the college and we had set up an activity for that now are today will start with the feedback of the activity arch waddell do right now i guess ill just quickly go to the hub a yesterdays sar activity slide so you had to do are the following activity yesterday as an individual you had to create one more page in your wordpress web page or you had to publish elbes an alex tease for the content discussed us blogs so the content was basically and petal content so they are entitled video resources available you have to create learning by doing activities and learning extension resources for those particular arm a bodys entitle resource now you had to link these blog posts into a back into the menu and peter this should be available in your individual wordpress web page now as a nazi what you had to do as a nazi you had to create a webpage it should have had three important pages we can have so many pages but are three important tabs were a highlighted one was the about or see pizza a homepage were description of the arcy are important activities done by the artsy etc are mentioned are then a link for participants also all the participants who are available in the darcy their web pages should be linked so the participant name and yet ask you to arm right the domain of these participants so a participant name and the domain so that others would know a bitch a domain this participant is and they could do a a they could interact with these participants more meaningfully and finally a plan of action now the plan of action is the steps to be done at the aussy to disseminate the entire information that has been collected a bayou within this word wordpress web page okay so arm let us look at what happened after that so i gave you the story so i had given your word document which you had two where you had to put your wordpress web page link so i as i understand from my admin team around ninety eight remote centers had participated in yesterdays abu interaction and let us have a look at what happened so this is the page that was shared with all of you so these are list of archived webpages now the instruction was please copy paste the url of our seas wordpress web page will now let us look at the total number of wordpress web pages that we have received so we hav or see one two two five one zero one six zero eighty puny arse hippie artsy one four two six seven one three one seven four six zero crusade is a one three one four so lets have a look at total number of hours so some people have actually given the description a the full details of darcy onto the ride which is really good a so a total of forty eight are seas had submitted their archive web pages now if you actually look at this now there are certain yellow ones over here and you could see that the course team have actually looked into a few of them and have given feedback so are the three yellow highlighted ones though not this one are the three yellow oil are the two yellow highlighted over here there were individual wordpress web pages and not archive a pages one has said that it is a great experience and it is really very innovative and the participant has shared her arse a wordpress webpage but unfortunately the arsys webpage was not shed so the feedback that we had given to that a participant was we appreciate your feedback though this is a very good individual websites unfortunately this is not a substitute for remote centers website which has a list of all participants and plan of action for integrity and petal videos now so which means that there was some issue in the transmission of information from our end too a you yesterday afternoon we take it as that many of you had doubts many of you had a did not really understand what was intended out of form this particular activity now ah if you actually look at top so i would just stamp also a comment about that plan of action now many people have either not given their plan of action or have misinterpreted it at some level now what was intended so in plan of action what was intended was how will you disseminate super examples of the instruction over there was steps to be done at aasi to disseminate so what you had to do as a group was to discuss various possible ways in which you as a group are you as an institution at the group of teachers will do a dissemination of whatever you have created now all of you have created web pages now ease creation of web pages alone sufficient for your students to actually get benefit out of no you should have a plan of action so just like how you do a teaching learning within your classroom you should have a plan of action as an institute to disseminate this information to the studio so how will the students come to know that there is a website that you created for them how will they know what is an albedo how will they know what they have to do after election day so ill show you one or two ill show you one exemplar a that was created by volkens a institute solapur so this is their wordpress website so they have a home were thereafter a talked about the institution then them i have talked about some of the innovative activities that they have done in their about page and then they created a list of parties other participants and they do me now when a user comes and sees this they know what exactly to look for so home they know about that it is about walchand about or see some of the innovative activities that have done at the r see list of participants who now when they look at the list of participants each of their ram domain so the first person is from a chemical engineering second is from database third is from computer science and engineering should have been very detail theyve given a detailed list of participants and in a nice table format but what is more important as they have actually given the plan of action of how they are going to disseminate this information within the a institute so lets look at the plan of action that they have come up so first identification of entitled video for the topic publish ladies and alex tees on website that is about fresh or on learning manage in a learning management system they have a learning management system called wood you will be will be discussing about elemis in the next week of the sbe a submission of albedo and alexi activities this is to be done by the students they will then evaluate the submissions and feedback to the students based on the evaluation and they would be an assignment based on the higher order thinking level now anybody who sees this as an institute they know what they have to do with their insured so if youre a teacher in walton they know what they have to do when they are to disseminate in petal a videos to the students first they are to identify the video then they have to grade their bodies and a list is for that video then this has to be given to the students where they will submit the albedo and electrcity activities this is then evaluated by the teacher and a feedback is given to the students based on evaluation and finally there will be a composite assignment based on the a higher order thinking levels up for that particular topic so people who want to see the webpage you can actually go and look into a arcy one one three one dot wordpress dot com you can actually look at their web page from this particular list that was given they are in the number where did the arcy one one three one seven number semidirect numbers seven and they have so this is one example now this is one exemplar that i have shown all each institute can have different plans of action need not be that it is done completely at top level from top to bottom there you may form groups within your institute you may form a smaller leather too three pair a pair and you start disseminating it within your classroom you can create separate sessions where you disseminate it in the classrooms there are various ways in which this could be done but let me now trackback a little at a track by the little and tell you why we have done this activity first so first and foremost what we wanted the main aim was that all of you so within an hour you have all the participants coming and sitting together on this is the only time that you can get the benefit of peer interaction and this peer interaction will be benefited because you get to a clear doubts that you have about the content you get to a understand what all has to be done about the activity so lot of benefits are there for the peer interaction within anarchy but more importantly there was another rationale why we created this activity let us look at the activity in detail so first we had asked an individual to create a individual with a to create a page within their wordpress that all of you would have created a wordpress webpage by now and we had asked you to create another page or another menu bar menu item within your wordpress web page now this is actually application of the knowledge that you have learnt in the past two weeks now over here what your getting the benefits you have a lord of piers along with you when you are actually doing this activity suppose you have any doubt you can actually talk to your pier and get help or clarification from and it is not limited to peer within your remote and you could actually interact with others who are present in other remote centers and get their feedback so i got a message from one of the course coordinator ver the course coordinator was telling me that they had actually gone and seen the wordpress web pages created by others in a different horses and had used that as an example for creating their own individual web page a bear they had to create the menu item and peter now this is exactly what we wanted one is that you apply what you learn second you do peer interaction in case you while you are applying this particular a learning and how will you transfer that your students see your students also require application of the knowledge that they learnt within a classroom setting where they are peers to help them and what you should do is provide a feedback to them at the end of the activity and you see i am giving you as an instructor i am actually giving you a feedback towards after you have done the first set of activity now lets look at the second aspect of the second verse you had to publish learning by doing and learning extension resources for the content discussed now ladies and alexis were the arm were taught to you in the first week of this particular effort now elby means you create it is slightly more than a multiple choice question forum or an open ended question learning by doing means the student will get time for practicing whatever they learnt from the videos or the learning dialogues along with practice what is more important is feedback so the moment you create an album you should provide what kind of feedback are you going to give the students it should be a constructive fid it should be telling them how to move ahead from where they were to what they had to do so adjust up over here i am at the start of the session i told you all of you had done different plans of action i showed you what the plan of action men and i showed you an example of a how you can actually translated so this is exactly what we intend from doing so first is that whatever you learned in the prior two weeks use the interaction session to apply it along with your peers that is the primary aim of the abuses you should apply along with peers so that you get feedback from peers and the purpose of the instructors at the end of the activity provide you a more generic feedback so that you can improve it the next time now as a nazi what you had to do was ensure that you bring all these together again as an archive also you did the same activity so you created a wordpress web page you created the three different items but what was more important was there was something more so there was an unsupervised question where you had to create a plan of action and all we had asked viewers steps to be done at an artsy to disseminate whatever you have created now this is more at a create level in a revised blooms taxonomy so you had to think what alt steps i will take you had to think how will i so i now that ive created a web page how should i now go ahead and disseminated and for this you had to discuss again with your peers like what all could be the pros and cons now what woodwork suppose i do this how much it will show you have to evaluate each of your plans and finally come up with a consolidated plan so you do analysis you do evaluation and finally you do a creation or synthesis activity and this is exactly what you should be doing in your own classrooms and we have the power of technology to enable or help you out in this activity so i hope all of you would now be thinking about what did you do yesterday what was intended where am i lacking or where did i go wrong what all should have improved where all should i have given my own individual are what is a higher order thinking abilities too a executed more effectively so ah there is an interesting question that is coming from archie one four one one arm so the army is asking a in chad to do analysis or discussion all the fellow participants need to be conversant with it is it not so ah yes so the answer is both a yes and no yes because ah yes all the participants should understand what was intended out of the activity but what is more important is within the classroom a no because even if they do not know they should use that opportunity to discuss about it in more detail now all of you are participants from all of your teachers from the same remote center a most of you as people who are from the same college they would know each other and their new participants also so this is exactly like your classroom so they are people there are groups who know each other really well there are some others who do a who are not it like a first day of classroom where lets say a lot of students come in some of them would be familiar with each other some of them would be a would be seeing some others for the first time but essentially all of them bring in some knowledge so letter all of the engineering students all of them with bring them bring with them some prior knowledge with the classroom with which they can discuss now as teachers each of us our idea or our ability should be to make sure that when all these people come together we make best use of that opportunity to make them discuss make them do activities together so that the collaborative collaboration among the among the learners would be higher now all that you need for to do that was lets you do an activity so a this activity sum is something that everyone knows creating a menu item in wordpress web page so this is like you give them some new i have a question or new activity based on their prior knowledge think of the first day in a classroom a all of you would have introduced yourself and after that teacher gives the first activity so the first activity would ideally be connected to rather than start of the a lesson so they would actually look at what are the prerequisites for the lesson and see whether they have the prerequisites right so to ensure the prerequisites lets say we give an activity within the classroom and beer utilizing that activity to ensure that people discuss and people are at the same level by the end of the activity and this is what we have done in our activity yesterday and there is no problems even if you are not able to complete the activity that was what is it that is not a problem for the instructor for the instructor what is important is that have you learnt how to do this activity more effectively so there are no minus points for not completing or are not submitting your wordpress web page there are no minus points for not coming up with a good plan of action there are no minus points for having a very a different wordpress web page the idea is having done that now when the instructor gives feedback today are you able to understand or are able to identify places where you need improvement are able to identify what you should do now to better or effectively do the same activity and this is all the purpose of this abuse sessions so we have a around hundred hundred and twenty remote centers are associated with us in this particular ifpi and for each aview session so we have a weekend debut session in this particular effort and in the next subject it went if deeply you will have an a two weekend sessions so for each weekend session the idea is whether you are able to apply muhammad go beyond basic application to more analysis evaluation and synthesis activities within the remote center along with your group and if there are issues we want each of you to a discuss with each other come up with queries a come up with questions for the instructor with a which can actually help you out a few that instructor can help you out the entire soa instructor can help a all the remote centers all the participants in all the remote centers more effectively so waddle doo is sore a there are so there are lot of questions with said that activity was confusing how to access wordpress for various activities ah so there are a mixed set of fab messages that are coming in and one four zero eight has asked plan of activities not clear and please discuss it again so rather than me discussing this oil waddell do us ill go to a floor transfer and ill give it to waltons solapur so arsey one one three one year walchand institute of solapur okay so what i give a rehab bolton in shooter solapur over here and what i will ask them to a explainers explain the plan of action to be entire group rather than instructor saying what it was all about i want the participants to say what the plan of action is all about a please go ahead arcy one month driven or the floor is yours a youre not audible artsy one one three one can you switch on the mike you are not audible yes god we lost your audio or even one proven unable to hear you or can you check your audio once again so participants please wait why we are spending so much time in discussing this is because in the next session what your going to do is one more level of application so we are going to give you a collaborative activity where each remote center will be in an obsession with art tend to leaven other remote centers so we have grouped you into a web grouped into eleven different separate groups and we will be transferring the control of a view to the remote center sudan be any itee bombay teacher who is present in that activity and it will be discussions between one center with other centers and will be some structure for that activity that will be explaining shortly but before that a will see whether arcy one month reagan has sorted out the issue so in the meanwhile i would request all arsys too actually look at the chat window there are lot of questions that are coming up in the chat window so they are raw agave or even one driven is asking for five minutes yes so what i would want each of you to do if there are some questions that are raw a put up regarding creation of wordpress web page addition of menu items ah there were a clarity in the activity so there are lot of questions that are coming in the chat window which i think many horses have the expertise in answering so what i would request the or cease to do now is a just have a look at the chat messages that are coming in and reply to them too a those questions are in the chat window itself so while replying please make sure that you address adi ar see who has asked the question are arci monthly finance a please provide the link to the google docs so that they will be able to access the asi won for zero it you have conducted in house sessions that is really good yes please put that in the innovations that have done not in plan of action plan of action is more about what you will do to disseminate the webpages that you have created so these chat messages are also showing some of the innovative activities that archives are doing adherents we know that a lot of horses are doing lot of good work for each of the earth is doing something very new and innovative for their own participants and this this is actually very important that others also come to know what your doing within your remote center to make these kind of eview sessions more effective so like i told last year we had mentors from the ars is explaining how to do a view much more are easily within their own a remote centers so what you should do when you login to a view are what are the different options how to raise questions etc so there is a question from mercy one for one month salvia discussion forums in wordpress like you do in your hybrid learning platform yes you please feel free so audio to do is enable commence in the wordpress how to share wordpress web page with other horses please refer the chat the mini aussies are responding with the a google doc link a whether peer interaction with participants need to be done within through the discussion forum it is good that if you do it within the discussion forum but if you have are sees a participants in the same mercy you can do it physically so there are reports like we have used social media like facebook and whatsapp yes you could use it make sure that others also you share so give a hashtag so that everybody can actually access that particular facebook posts so why dont you use the hashtag hash if dtype won zero onix it is a unique hash tag and all the participants were using facebook can now look into the messages related to my fd one zero one using this hashtag hash if dtype one zorua one ex a there are also questions regarding creative commons license i take up the issue of licensing etc at a later stage but if they are arses who understand creative commons licensing please respond to arm arcy one one six one so there are some good questions that are coming up in arcy one three six seven am in a different in the chart window and a lot of other horses are actually responding to that and am really happy that our seas are now utilizing the affordance of the chart a in a view to discuss their doubts and queries more raw frequently and one message for all our seas when you use technology something that i learnt just nowas uni the instructor to first give a top down in a body shape a addresses like this was not really done really well why dont you go ahead and use the technology so maybe one a take away that i would suggest is why dont you do the first instance of usage of technology within the classroom where you encourage people to solicit you have a classroom and you want to make students discuss in a in wordpress or in other mediums why dont you do it inside the classroom and see what the differences so the question quality is also increasing a somebody had asked about how to post questions in the blog and now arcy one to seven it is asking in one level on top of it but can we mention darkly mention questions in blog with multiple choice questions archive one three six four one to know how to take a create everyday so that they can take feedback from the learners and in fact a very good question from arci one one four zero so the question is is it not if everyone follow the same procedure then we will end up with killing creativity it is correct so the question is if i give standard instructions for all wouldnt everyone do it similarly and we would have any diverse answers or diverse solutions coming from the participants so the answer is yes and no yes because as if it is like up its like we we are not doing an assembly line a process now each one of you would do something very differently and as an instructor you have to be very careful as to how much your gig going to give details and how much you are going to leave it open and now are many people feel that suits students many teachers so this is a regular complaint that i receive from a teachers when they talk about their foods todays students require a require us to us to spoon feed them when they want all the answers they want all these things in detail given to them so there is there is truth in having some structure and there is also the a need for it to be sufficiently open ended specifically in higher education in the higher education a sector that is the only place where students are now being forced to think out of the box or are they get the opportunity to be more creative a bits they are learning how it should have been done right from their schooling where they should have had more of such collaborative activities more of these project activities more of these application activities but unfortunately many schools or many systems are not unable to do it and we are trying as teachers we are trying to ensure that you a the a teachers get empowered as prose of attack said we are not limiting to injuring a be our wish is not to limit it at engineering education alone even more teachers to benefit from these kind of activities and hence it is important that as teachers you also get a flavour of what it is to have open ended activities now there was some sufficient structure the structure was that each of you had to create wordpress webpage both individually and as a nazi and you had to share the artsy webpage in the google docs now this is the structure that we give and we had left how you do this creation of a pagan and a given olive berry a top level instruction on what the web page should contain the actual activity was to be done by the aussie and the individual so we had given sufficient room for creativity up within the answers but some amount of structure because without structure just giving living an activity to be opened but it would create in the caves particularly at school so when you have a close to three thousand participants all of them doing a open ended activities would create in lord of a chaotic environment so you have wordpress activity done here there somebody has done like this so it would be really hard to make sense of what the activity was and hence we had asked you to a do it with some structure so artsy one one three one are you ready a audio we are able to see your raw video sastra university is asking of one one four zero is asking a lot of good questions are i will come back you shatter university are the same questions a there are some valid questions that a vast please give some time for me to come back you will definitely answer the questions i have noted the questions okay archive anman thriven a unable to come up with the audio a have you checked the mike no oh no valves in solapur am unable to hear your voice at all please secure audio connections a buns so outwardly what i would suggest you use a canoe creator to a two slides on what you did what you understood from the activity and are what you earn how you did the activity two slides with the essential information you can arm put that in your wordpress web page and once youre done share that wordpress webpage with us or that slide with us so that we will display to the entire set of participants okay so i am unable to hear you file stop interaction with you right now so there were two questions from arci one one four zero are regarding a get the question was if the graded activities are the same how to ensure that participants are students do not copy now or if the graded activities at the same yes there is a threat that a students can copy arm sofa rub inevitably one zero and there is good to be a summative assessment activity where we are going to give random questions two students were building a question bank and the technology of idema makes actually helps us in giving random questions to ask the students each student will see a different question and we are creating a big repository of questions from where you could get so out of the hundred questions any student can get any ten out of them so that is one way in which through which you should leverage the use of technology technology provides you up facility of randomizing a questions and you should actually try to use it now we are not using that in a knowledge quiz andor a assimilation a quizzes because at that point it is only application of the knowledge that is more important so each week you have applied some you have learnt something whether you are able to applied that is more important and many times the resource creation activity which is the higher order activity that we are going to create from monday onwards that will actually tell us whether the faculty is able to actually apply whatever they have learnt from the weeks before soup activities like this each of you were asked to create web pages each of you work asked to create a menu item within the webpage how those are instances where we are actually trying to judge whether you are able to do the prescribed activity correctly or know a damn let me see whether there are some more questions so one more important thing is sore the next session that theyre going to have we are going to have each of you log into an ebook lasso so ah here we will try to see whether you are able to make sense of it are you a a are able to do the interactions individually within a remote centers are able to do lot of these collaborative activities without the supervision of the instructor that means us id bombay all being present gauges leaving you there and we are trying to see whether you are able to do the interactions among yourself in a smaller group and see how much effective those are in the arm in the execution of this i was so last time we had done a similar exercise where we had each mentor interact with fifty or a forty to fifty mentees together and these sessions were found to be very productive now here we are trying to do the same but with between remote centers i am looking into the question so there are people who are actually talking about various features of wordpress and how you can effectively use it some artsy one to five is asking what is the advantage of wordpress over other free beverage a recreation site so the major advantage is so i think calm arcy one four two six has responded that wordpress also allows for several widgets are the just to add onto that answer most important reason why you should be using wordpress is because it is free and open source the open source feature of wordpress is why you should be using wordpress which means that you can actually make changes in the a download the wordpress code make changes in the code and actually customize wordpress for your need and they allow it to do a allow you as a to do do that that is one reason so many of the softwares that we are primarily a using within this particular if they are free and open source like camstudio wordpress see iety bombay eggs and a the ideabox site which has both drupal and open idiots then there is a model which is going to come next all these are open source softwares which means that there is also control to the usa and how it looks okay so let me just a do few interactions which are sees a at this point so i hope for a while have verb arci won one driven a upload their slides in sometime and ill describe that in a few moments so at this point ill take five questions from arsy so are people who have questions kindly are raise your hand or do a henrys right now or we will do a first come first serve answer the questions on a first come first serve basis and then we will give you instructions on what you have to do in the next session okay so i have a arcy one four zero to workman college of engineering blue hello can you hear listen yes can we add animations and simulations are directly in wordpress ah okay so the question is can we add animations or simulations you can add aslong as it is present in another website you can add them if you are i am trying to upload it in wordpress in the wordpress dot com domain there are some restrictions to the size you can have only up to a three gibby size as of now sophia simulations and animations are arm be above the adat size limit will not be able to upload eden sizes restriction yes oh yes so a nextas arcy one zero six three ah daiji patil college of engineering and technology pimpri a halo halo man guided much a good morning myself misses magura bikini from imight academy of engineering pune grazed my questionnaire in wordpress a we are giving the questions which are the multiple choice questions yes yes to kistler disney pushes are stewart insists so and when the students are giving answers to this shot and sees how to evaluation because everyone giving the shortened season different a week and lindy are lindy answers the how to evaluate the url in the questions are short answer questions okay so the question that has been asked a by myra mam from ma why every man from arci one one zero six three i think i had seen the same question from several other participants file do a general a response with the question was how to give a questions and answers which are in descriptive in nature so multiple choice questions can be enabled through multiple ways like a you could embed a google form or you could actually ask the question with the options in text format within the wordpress and phpbb but they are in engineering i read specifically you need open ended answers short answers etc how to do those using wordpress now the answer to this is wordpress is a content management system it is not a learning management system and what your trying to do or the learning activities of the learning activities to be present in a content management system you need to check whether there are plugins available for these kinds of activities of this would convert a content management system to be a learning management system now in the upcoming week we are going to discuss learning management systems in detail but for each technology see the a top level a thing is that each technology has a purpose and the purpose of a technology like wordpress is to gather content and disseminated more effectively or it that is why it is called a content management system so the purpose of content management system is too a you should understand what this technology is useful for an use it for that purpose primarily this is where its effectiveness increases now aview is a virtual classroom software now within this virtual classroom you could do document sharing you could share animations you could do a chat you could ask queries henrys etc but you cannot do a large scale evaluation using a bow because this software is not meant for that you cannot have individual participant come in and right answers and a teacher sit here and give marks directly through ebay they are there is no back and where they store marks they display the grades to the students etc so each technology has a primary purpose for which it has been built and when you look at these technologies you should actually a identify what the primary purposes and use it for the primary purpose alone ah so i hope ive made myself clear map it thank you sir are a bit again a rare thing a drag but when the stories are sagging or are writing the short insists so i think according to a we can judge they are thinking capability in terms of multiple choice questions are what happy the students can easily see the other sciences and they can easily attain the quicker they can easily give the answers but a incase of shortened somewhat happen everyone will write in their own words and that we can start thinking about that a particular content that is what i think are the complete individual videos visit er your correct and the user by using a learning management system for are doing this we are talking we are going to talk about model in the fourth way so you could actually explore model a lot more to a create your short answer questions okay okay thank you so angry man okay so let me move to aussie one one four zero a shastra university i mizuki yeahi have we ever question your name sir am ime that adorably from sos rhinos re okay god i believe we have some cushion like earth is this icy de should be limited to some extent for example zimbra if you have a three thousand students attending the same goes all over india a uci away there is a difference between playing in the ground and a video game right yes so attending a teacher a teachers class the teacher derive their particular equation we in the teacher will tell you oh what strip you need to follow and how you need to write write and how you need to solve some critical equations and all those things the teacher derive step by step where you say nice city at the end when we share some a powerpoint or rabbi biddy am in a video even some cases where we have some audio video that is really not enough in my opinion and finally what agencies like you know we dont simply follow the gundam but also the professor by that way we miss that deny city is it okay so the question that has been raised by procera nitrogen from arcy one one four zero esr should there be a limit to usage of icity even he has given an orgy of are playing a game actually on ground versus playing a game in a video game or on computer or things like that oh there are certain things that the physical presence of appear or an instructor in the classroom bringin in the learning process which the technologies unable to mimic a so is it that we should limit the usage of high city or is it that we should use yhe city for a specific purpose allow now to answer this question let me just ask a person natarajan also which game do you place a do you play a cricket or something like that football a kabaddi weeplay kabaddi okay so my question is have you seen the pro kabaddi league they watched the probable yes yes okay so my question is after watching the probe kabaddi leather match in pro kabaddi league what role do you get about a teams performance how should a leather radars netaji yam strategy okay new techniques or something like that okay so you see new techniques and you see a lot of new things from the a video we are seeing a video right yes okay so the idea is that i city has a purpose every technology has a purpose for which it is built now specifically learning technologies the purpose is to provide an instance or provide some different examples of various ways in which something could be done so for example the video the video is a nicety video video game as a nice it is basically about how you can do a strategy in a very safe environment where you wouldnt be producing a physically injured while doing this you would be a wooden have to face injuries i wouldnt have to get a word you said a harsh feedback from your friends or peers also there are certain things that also it is exactly like a lab environment okay so everybody knows what a lab environment it is safe it is controlled it is very it is very much to the point there is a point by we do something and allah now when we move from the safe environment to a real environment what you would need are these additional elements where that is where the pedagogy of the teacher and the collaboration from the pier is imported now this is something that everyone should know the first week we talked about learning dialogues we talked about learning by doing activities we talked about learning experience interactions we talked about learning extensions now learning by doing is actually how to make videos more useful for the lord now in a learning dialogue you watch a video then at some point a reflection spot question comes to this question will make the student thick now this is not if this is not done in a video this is done outside and the student uses another technology letter word editor to actually write the answer in their caution then we had a learning experience interaction activity were the scores journal was shared with others and they gave feedback on certain aspects about the caution and you also had learning by doing activities immediately following the learning dialogue so whenever they learned something they did the practice than in the air itself using some other activity here we use the multiple choice questionability of i debarked to actually facilitate this particular practice so to answer the question or should we limit the use of a city you already the icity by itself comes with certain limitations but what you should do is make sure that you maximize the usage within that limitation use it more effectively and this particular referee series are the hefty one is about introducing you to the technology and if deemed too is about the pedagogies that you can use with these technologies and even within a fd be one we are trying to show you various pedagogies that you can use with various technologies now are you so how chat could be used within a view to discuss among participants you saw how wordpress pages could be used more effectively so are the answers are so the short answer is should we limit the use of ay city for me we should not limit the use of ay city arm a within a classroom but rather as a teacher we should know what the limitations of the city are and use it accordingly hope i have made myself clear your easy is it not like murray city you say that if our example thousand students attend the same goes for example okay so here you see you replace you know you have only one teacher instead of ict in teacher okay i am really worried about the future generation where in our generation really in both classroom and the video glasses and all the sing okay what even if there is after two generations the students believe only they icity and only the asian and african asian and ali begin okay okay so this question is the fear of the odyssey will teachers be completely replaced and will the future be that only icity comes now ah i think the fear is misplaced if he actually look at this particular if deep itself why are we doing it in a blended fashion so we are doing it in a blended fashion because we require that human presence at each place so even a purse individually you cannot reach to three thousand people at the same time but what it would require is actually three thousand course coordinators three thousand ave you coordinators a barb sorry hundred aview coordinators and hundred courts coordinators to facilitate this particular a technology so that pre thousand people benefit so if you believe i mean from what ive seen till now a hub each technology it replaces certain rudimentary functions that a teacher needed to do a lot more so for example a ben video comes the teacher actually conserves our says time of not requiring to repeat the same lecture hundred times rather the teacher can use the same video a in hundred classes and teacher can spend that time in understanding what the queries of the students are and making certain a pedagogic strategies to ensure that more students learn from the same resource and this is true of any digital technology any digital technology any job not just teaching learning the technology is replacing certain rudimentary functions of that particular job but it is also providing need for certain other things to happen around so when a teacher stops lecturing the teacher has to spend more time creating meaningful questions and meaningful activities now dont you think that you would need more than fifteen teachers to actually do this and this is what all this if dip is about how would you re position yourself from being a a sage on the stage to an effective facilitator i think this is really very interesting you know to see all the teachers from all over the universitys and interacting in all these things are really nice this technology i really agree and also we also use the video lectures and are looking in the class but my only worry is like yuno in future review if you have an auditorium in a university you will have a thousand students and all attend the same pose and a simple exit you need to have also died and so here is misplaced i win a let me assure you that your raw so all the teachers who worry about that the teachers you do not dry however teachers when technology comes in please note that your fears are misplaced because the more technology concerned the more there is requirement of teachers because you need a teacher to clearly give you the correct feedback now subjective feedbacks so each of you how will you you cannot have multiple choice questions to grade everyone you need more creative activities you aware you need to factor in the variations and other things so the job of a teacher would it is only that you will just shift from being a sage on the stage to facilitator where you could do a lot more things than what you could do at this moment okay so let me now are a move to the next remote center so this arcy one three six seven send vinson polit a college nagpur yeah hello hello hello sir do ya so can you introduce an element in the engineering okay okay when i adhere to photographing the beer my add media there appearing one below okay i wont appear side by side in other species it in gwozdecky the oak harbor oh okay what is your second question i reckoned i do not want the blog i should be able to get it in romanian okay ah so this is a wordpress related query so the query is that when you upload all images are they not align there that you want it to be aligned side by side and you do not want it to be one below the other and the second question is you do not want the blocks to be at the homepage now ah the art to answer the first question how to you how do you set up the allignment i think when you go to the esteemed editor you can use certain establ tags are basically you do a page alignment within the esteemed editor to actually do the side by side am i a have a faint idea but what i would request all horses all participants in the arse is see the question is are somebodys uploading two photographs into wordpress web page and the the person wants to be side by side i know that alignment would take care of it but i dont exactly remember how you do the alignment what i would request all participants in oasis if you have done this recently can you kindly posted in the chat so that a a professor could actually benefit from anda regarding your second question sub a blocks from the menu or you can go to your dashboard by writing your rub you aural the does whatever is dot wordpress dot com slash the bloopy admin you will go to the dashboard and bends you select blogs you can uncheck do not appear in homepage so you can actually select the appropriate page that you want as hope by selecting that page and selecting that us homepage please we are please do look out for the chat answers that are coming because ive i expect lot more people to answer your question through chat okay the last two questions are this is from or see one four zero seven army institute of technology maharashtra pune gnu hello hello good morning good morning and doctors roma aity your question is regarding the content curation oak i inner content curation are you tool that we can organize audio as per the topic we can collect the videos or material and a can publish it yes so are ya regarding that if there are a individual videos some are very lengthy so can we modify them and insert in between aussie are video and that is first one here is there any copyright issue with that and second is can we insert the date and time a for the newly created video and kenny publish it option can insert noodles are good questions are let ya let me just the seo process sangeeta had two questions regarding content curation process so very specific question as a verb and petal widows are slightly longer and requires a lot more time to be invested so can she break it up add her own videos or make it shorter along with adding her own widows cami and also a way when they create these new videos can these be published up in youtube or other places what are the copyright issues that she has to look for a okay so the answer to this question as sahib i believe most of the and petal videos are now in open source are the means are they allow it they arent creative commons so any video that is in creative commons with says reuss allowed you can take and you can make modifications but that is a that is exactly what this open source or creative commons is all about so any video with a creative commons licensing you can do all that what you had asked just now and it can be re published also but a specifically are you should look at what kind of creative commons licensing has been applied now in this week along with screen casting we had actually shared some initial information about creative commons licensing what a sissy by also there is a very open license called seas is zero which means that you can use it as you want and basic then you have see buy essay which means that whatever you create you have to put it in a year to share it in creative commons alone then the recipe by ency you cannot used for commercial purposes and that is no derivatives so you cannot have any debt derivatives coming out of it so it should be used in a hole under the mixture of these licenses that are also used a please refer to the creative the section on creative commons licensing an arty bombay but will try to do is sore i lost the course is to add more information about creative commons licensing in the upcoming week so that you will have most of all the participants will get more clarity about creative commons licensing again arm all are participants who are in other horses if you have answers too are the question regarding creative commons please post them in chat or you can visit or see one four zero seven website and give a comment to them are in the wordpress website okay once a year so let me now go to the nexts a horsey horsey one two to three are obvious engineering technical campus agra hello hello good morning my january blohm argues it is yum okay my question is about wordpress wordpress software okay the ones i created my web address him a wordpress so if i wanted to change my baby dress so what is the procedure oak ah so this is again a generic question that many people i saw this question i saw this question being asked are in the discussion forums also so the question is you have created a wordpress domain page which you want to change the name how do you do it now you can do this from your dashboard go to your wordpress dot you login to your wordpress site and after that you add the following into your raw domains you are so let your ra but was named a babys name a sanjay tiwari dot wordpress dot com login to it and then sangeet worried about press dot com slash the bloopy admin of this is your admin dashboard go to this admin dashboard and look for domains in the left there you can see an option how to change the domain and you can give the new domain name as long as it is not taken okay okay thank you so ah that is a the i would stop the interaction now because we would need a job i would need to explain the next sessions activity to all of you and i also look at whether arcy one one three one has shared their rap a powerpoint slide with us by this time so what i am going to do now is what you are going to do in the next session so in the next two sessions a day starting from levon thirty till three thirty what your going to do if your going to interact using a view with other remote centers now for this we have set up a view classrooms are today with the groups up with a specific set of groups or you will see once you log out of this particular set up a out of this classroom in your ave you dashboard you will see specific groups that are coming or its in the class in the a section called class you will see a each of your classrooms listed you can go into the classroom just like how you go to this a reach the tests a class the if dtype class the same process going to the classroom one of you one of the remote center would be the teacher in that the others would be participants and what i would want you to discuss is what worked for you in yesterdays arm group activity so as an entire remote center you should present what you did yesterday to the other remote centers and you should take up one question from another remote cent so each each of you would get ten minutes for a presentation and answering one question so this is a and ab a each classroom you will have a main arm remote center would be assigned as a teacher the teacher should ensure that you hand over the arm a presenter access to the ar see who is presenting so ill just stop at just a have a look at awkward elders ill share the groups with you are in a slide just now unchecked so we have a remote centralized grouping that we have war destruction and this particular slide is shown are right now so what do you sees this is group number one a arcy one three one six is that as a teacher role in an all other horses are in student role or the second group is a the teacher rulers for arcy one zero one two and all others have student roles a arcy one zero five eight is the teacher in the third group of this is the fourth group with arcy one zero nine it if you see the username is the same username that youre using for entering the eff dippy class a remote center one one zero zero is the fifth one ascii one one zero eight is the sixth seventh or see one one five three one one three one is in group paid assi one to five in group name or see one two nine nine is a group pen and you have the eleventh group which is artsy one three five three now as soon as you log out from the eff dippy class the same class would be visible in your aview class today so you can log into that classroom and start interacting with other horses and most important is what you should discuss now this is a group activity will be sharing that particular pippity slide now with everyone please of bait for the complete instructions so the instruction for the group activities each r see bill get ten minutes for presenting what they did yesterday and they should take one question from the other horses so each are sea should be doing a presentation let sit about five to six minutes and they should answer one other question from another artsy or who are in that particular group what should they present to the other horses how they did the activities yesterday what they understood from the activity also the activities your rap creating artsy webpage as well as creating individual web pages for unbeaten so the instructions you should be presenting two other horses a what you understood from yesterdays activities and how you did yesterdays activity now each are sea then can have a generic question regarding the presentation or a generic question regarding the content of the digital now to this presenting ours now each are she will get ten minutes and you have a maximum of ten are sees in a in a group surround hundred minutes which requires a verb which means that it is slightly more than one hour fourty five minutes or so this a beer giving you time from a eleven thirty till three thirty to do this activity and what do we expect you to do at the end of this presentation you should have a list of questions that you answered and you should have an understanding of what happened yesterday and how you could have done it more effectively now i am now uploaded the pdf of the groups here in the slides right now you can download the slides from a view a using the download often right click and download the slides from there but what is important as you interact now i know that in a typical ave you are it will take so that it will have some issues of connectivity a connections how it comes together etc so maybe hundred minutes may not be sufficient so that is why we are given two sessions completely dedicated to this activity so from leavened thirty till three thirty you will be doing a connecting to the your new classroom and you will be presenting to each other what you have done at each remote and so are the iety bombay team will not be coming into any remove any of those classroom but rather we are having taking screenshots of what is happening in each classroom just to see how active each of you were one thing for all participants what you have to look out for us if you have certain specific questions to the archive on how they have done the web a wordpress creation and if there are any technical doubts this is the time that you should be using to get your doubts clarified so as a top the group if you completed your presentations a the remaining time till three thirty you can devote in racing specific questions and finding answers and at the end of it if you have some unanswered questions please bring them to the final session where we will do the final feedback so will have our final session from four a clock to five thirty where we will be doing floor transferred to each are sees understanding what happened and if there are certain questions that are there we will be taking that up and our peers will be answering those questions in the coming days and will be putting them up in ati permits so i hope a okay so there are questions of a rig from the remote centers so the question from dronacharya arcy one three one six dronacharya pledge was a teacher in this a particular thing see the role of teacher is to be the main a person to a who will be the will be transferring control to different races now an ebu works in a teacher student mood so teacher has the control of aview always are and the teacher has to transfer the control to the student when they are presenting now bare selected these remote centers based on their star ratings and their quality of a view up in our previous faculty development programs so we expect that as a view coordinators and escos coordinators youll be knowing how to transfer control to a how to operate aview effectively for a giving presentation time too a the a other remote centers so your role is so you yourself has to present and you should also transfer control to others for presentation and as a teacher one more important role as a group you should very much limit yourself to ten minutes you should do the presentation within ten minutes and you should be very strict on the time okay ah but shall be so there are questions on virtually find questions though so the questions will be asked by the remote centers to you so let me repeat the instructions once more step one you will close this classroom at eleven a clock and a you will see a list of a groups a passes according to the list that we have given over here so you have to enter that particular classroom at eleven thirty the teacher a has to start the presentation so the presentation is about what you did in your remote center yesterday afternoon and you should detail out but old ways in which you tried collaboration at the end of your presentation you should take one question from another aussie now how will other races ask questions they should use andreas they should use hand raise option and teacher should select the appropriate arm they should are the teacher can now select the appropriate arsey and so for example i have so i am an avid teacher now show you what youre seeing right now is a a the teacher iety bombay and a lot of students out there now when you enter your classroom you will see similarly a teacher and each of you will enter that classroom as students now the teacher role is played by me or hear nowadays i go to the first student was given a handy so whenever a student raises a hand i will see a red question mark in my teacher interface now as a teacher interface what you have to do us a right click on it and start interaction the fame should be done by the teacher when the teacher finishes the presentation and when they have to transfer the control to a the student by making them a present so right click start interaction so now go to the video wall now you will see are what youre seeing right now is a hearty one three one six one one three five abuses each are fee will be able to connect to you and their video will be present in the video wall so all are sees what else to do is the teachers of each group will now transfer this control and give time for the hours is to present so the entire presentation and answering the questions should be done in ten minutes okay so supposing that your so the bi presentation what be menus you have to describe what your done you dont have to upload any file okay so by presentation what we mean is a face to face presentation so the course coordinator and the group of teachers within the hour she should tell the other so that is as in speech they should tell the other or sees what they have done for yesterdays activity and at the end of their presentation they should take questions from other office about the activities that have done so you have to do an oral presentation to other races and each ar see who is viewing this presentation at the end of the presentation should use the handrail button to ask questions to the artsy first about the presentation and if time permits you should ask questions regarding content of the eff up the username and passwords for you is the same as that you use for entering the dippy class so there are no change all your doing right now is your doing a breakout session where each student in the class they are moving out of this classroom and assembling in a different virtual classroom in a view now therell be a maximum of ten to eleven students or classes are sees in a single classroom virtual class so we have set up the groups like the each r see gets ten minutes presentation time within this ten minutes they will do the oral presentation of what they have done in there are few yesterday and what challenges did they face at the end of the presentation they will take up questions from other horses and try to answer at all this within ten
