i am unable to hear you file stop interaction with you right now so there were two questions from arci one one four zero are regarding a get the question was if the graded activities are the same how to ensure that participants are students do not copy now or if the graded activities at the same yes there is a threat that a students can copy arm sofa rub inevitably one zero and there is good to be a summative assessment activity where we are going to give random questions two students were building a question bank and the technology of idema makes actually helps us in giving random questions to ask the students each student will see a different question and we are creating a big repository of questions from where you could get so out of the hundred questions any student can get any ten out of them so that is one way in which through which you should leverage the use of technology technology provides you up facility of randomizing a questions and you should actually try to use it now we are not using that in a knowledge quiz andor a assimilation a quizzes because at that point it is only application of the knowledge that is more important so each week you have applied some you have learnt something whether you are able to applied that is more important and many times the resource creation activity which is the higher order activity that we are going to create from monday onwards that will actually tell us whether the faculty is able to actually apply whatever they have learnt from the weeks before soup activities like this each of you were asked to create web pages each of you work asked to create a menu item within the webpage how those are instances where we are actually trying to judge whether you are able to do the prescribed activity correctly or know a damn let me see whether there are some more questions so one more important thing is sore the next session that theyre going to have we are going to have each of you log into an ebook lasso so ah here we will try to see whether you are able to make sense of it are you a a are able to do the interactions individually within a remote centers are able to do lot of these collaborative activities without the supervision of the instructor that means us id bombay all being present gauges leaving you there and we are trying to see whether you are able to do the interactions among yourself in a smaller group and see how much effective those are in the arm in the execution of this
