should we limit the use of ay city for me we should not limit the use of ay city arm a within a classroom but rather as a teacher we should know what the limitations of the city are and use it accordingly hope i have made myself clear your easy is it not like murray city you say that if our example thousand students attend the same goes for example okay so here you see you replace you know you have only one teacher instead of ict in teacher okay i am really worried about the future generation where in our generation really in both classroom and the video glasses and all the sing okay what even if there is after two generations the students believe only they icity and only the asian and african asian and ali begin okay okay so this question is the fear of the odyssey will teachers be completely replaced and will the future be that only icity comes now ah i think the fear is misplaced if he actually look at this particular if deep itself why are we doing it in a blended fashion so we are doing it in a blended fashion because we require that human presence at each place so even a purse individually you cannot reach to three thousand people at the same time but what it would require is actually three thousand course coordinators three thousand ave you coordinators a barb sorry hundred aview coordinators and hundred courts coordinators to facilitate this particular a technology so that pre thousand people benefit so if you believe i mean from what ive seen till now a hub each technology it replaces certain rudimentary functions that a teacher needed to do a lot more so for example a ben video comes the teacher actually conserves our says time of not requiring to repeat the same lecture hundred times rather the teacher can use the same video a in hundred classes and teacher can spend that time in understanding what the queries of the students are and making certain a pedagogic strategies to ensure that more students learn from the same resource and this is true of any digital technology any digital technology any job not just teaching learning the technology is replacing certain rudimentary functions of that particular job but it is also providing need for certain other things to happen around so when a teacher stops lecturing the teacher has to spend more time creating meaningful questions and meaningful activities now dont you think that you would need more than fifteen teachers to actually do this and this is what all this if dip is about how would you re position yourself from being a a sage on the stage to an effective facilitator i think this is really very interesting you know to see all the teachers from all over the universitys and interacting in all these things are really nice this technology i really agree and also we also use the video lectures and are looking in the class but my only worry is like yuno in future review if you have an auditorium in a university you will have a thousand students and all attend the same pose and a simple exit you need to have also died and so here is misplaced i win a let me assure you that your raw so all the teachers who worry about that the teachers you do not dry
