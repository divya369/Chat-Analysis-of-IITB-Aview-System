so yes it is doable but make sure that there is some kind of moderation that you are doing so you dont want everybody to post random thoughts so some guidance to beta in class tips or outside class tips the teepee yes has to be very carefully designed and implemented by the instructor also a sort of in a lighter vein that atp is will anyway happen outside class okay because before the exam your students are ready we going to be talking to each other they are going to be no discussing and all of that so what the important focus for you is to make sure that it happens in class also no so if we what we want to do is effectively utilize time see you are the resource and that resource should be available to the student for doing you know higher cognitive level activities when they are doing higher cognitive level activities that is a time when they need your presence so in the class the more number of such activities you organize and dino youre able to execute the more beneficial it will be to the students outside of the class know you could go ahead and do all the online tips activities but that will anyway happen you know around the web because students will talk to each other especially noob just before the exams thats a fairly a natural process that happens i am not pointing out that i am talking home structured but informal probably dependability do i think its funny but a structured way of doing infinite share nightly to it i think the headache and also alerts are pointed out it is not necessary why open necessary to have it online you have been eating out can even have that offline mode but the structure what we do it in e he unearths sipc nasdaq we can even have a bigger penis how to reconcile that gives more time movie we can have it inside it nothing thats fine but now we can give that part time at all we can give more time but doing something more deep and into the higher up and thats what my opinion worry think would be a yes it is valid are again what you said is correct so doing it in a structured way just ensure that as an instructor your presence is also present in the out of the class because generally all these activities as prosser riot are told you right now other students should also feel that the instructor support is also present that is what they get inside the class so if this some amount of it is also present outside the class there is no harm in it she in in the tips activity the instructor has two important roles first role is in structuring setting up of the activity what will happen in the think face what will happen in the pair face and so okay so if the instructor does not do a proper job there then the tips will fail so if the instructor is done a proper job in the think faced the pair face these two perhaps can happen outside the classroom however the instructor also has a major role to play in the share face so if the shares is going to happen outside the classroom the instructor has to figure out a way to be present during the surface so ideally allow even if you want to do tips out of class what i would recommend is that you can let them think phase and the pair face happen out of class but the sheer face you must have you know you your presence is necessary during the share phase in order to know summarize in order to re clarify a common errors that are being made and so on okay there seems to be one more question at the center here i go with a peer assessment process net united account
