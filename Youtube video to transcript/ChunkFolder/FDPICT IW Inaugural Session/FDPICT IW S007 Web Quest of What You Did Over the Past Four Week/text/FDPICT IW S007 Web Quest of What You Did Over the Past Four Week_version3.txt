so if you had the information and if you had the ability to communicate that information effectively you are considered to be a good teacher in the twentieth century since twenty first century however thats no longer true everybody has access to the information in fact while youre conducting a class its possible that lot of students will be no checking online immediately about what your saying what are the counter points to the point that youre making and so so the access to information is no longer a problem so what is important now as teachers is for us to be able to help students to develop these skills of critical thinking of collaboration and being able to evaluate and synthesize information into what is useful for them okay so one of the reasons for the safety is that while you may not be able to implement all of these techniques in your classroom so we are not expecting that hundred percent of you will be able to implement hundred per cent of all the techniques that are being taught but however what is important is to have the awareness so there is a a there are formal models one of them is called the technology integration matrix a which has various stages that a teacher goes through in integrating technology into their teaching learning process the first step here is awareness do you have to first be aware that such technologies exist and irrespective of whether you can use them in your class today or not this awareness is what contributes towards your becoming more effective the second step is to develop some appreciation for the technology or what it can do to be able to critically evaluate okay when will this technology be useful in my class when i should use it when i need not use it and so on okay so awareness is the first step then appreciation is the second step then comes adoption in italy the third step that you actually adopt the technology the technology now hear can be a a i city base technology or it can simply be a classroom based technology which is a pedagogy basically so all of these things the whole idea is that once you develop the awareness and appreciation that is when itll be possible to adopt them in the classroom so if a large number of you now all of you would have reached the awareness stage so the way we have designed this program is through a principle called immersively wherein you are in instead of simply telling you about these things we have actually made you experience them as a learner and we have made you create such activities for the learners in your class so that is the steps that we are taking to say that okay after awareness we can do appreciation because you have actually engaged in such an activity and then you go to adoption wherein you create such activities for your students so even if you are not able to implement all the activities that you create there is no need to feel that you know this is just for somebody else its not useful for me the awareness in the appreciation will go a long way and maybe a couple of years down the line a lot of these will become possible to implement on a routine basis in many classrooms so that is one of the things that i wanted to kind of emphasis in this survey todays interaction the other point that i wanted to emphasize is the point about collaboration so just like ive been saying that its a students need to develop the skill of collaboration we as teachers also need to develop the skill of collaboration is now this happens in multiple ways two of which we are adopting in this course is one way is the collaborative resource creation so that is what a christian was saying some time back where we will be having community resources which we created and these resources collaboratively created by all of us becomes a global
