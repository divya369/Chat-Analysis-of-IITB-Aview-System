in persia whereas the second one i had only one on one or two active learning strategies but still it had time allotted for one or two this is an important thing that needs to be focused while doing a lesson designed the entire a lecture has to be focused sardar patel institute i have a liking to perrys fencing is a teen peer assessment where getting feedback from the people there talkin implement any other mechanism where we can even just sit back concealed back then it will be like like youre some kind of psycho values their feedback because we have seen that thing most of the people they are not even looking at the segment engages in some random kind of like comments so sometimes it is like a very dismal demotivating and another thing that i long to suggestions that i mean maybe from your tears or something like two thre a baby exporting that particular can be appointed as a like observing this particular process so is it possible to implement this mechanism so both of these are good ideas i know one way in which year in which you can give feedback on feedback is to be simply able to say no to what extent you agree with his back and to what extent that feedback was useful to you you know so a simple rating of the feedback is possible i dont know to what extent our system will be able to implement this right away and the second thing about no expertise at our end evaluating so some a little bit of that is possible but it cannot be done on a large scale simply because of numbers allow we dont have that many number of days and so what we will see is to what extent it is possible for you to rate the feedback that is given to you i think that is a good suggestion we will try to see whether it is possible for you to say hello i strongly agree with the feedback this feedback was useful to me or not and in that way we can at least know who are the people were giving useful feedback and or not so are just too answer based on technology yes our current model pair assessment are has this drawback that you are not able to give feedback on feedback so that is why we have a separate feedback about the peer assessment process so where we have asked you how a detail did you give feedback harmony reviews did you get arm how helpful were the feedbacks the peer feedback to you and me gently asked an open ended question on what your own feelings about the peer assessment process so that is one mechanism through which we have implemented the feedback and feedback are the other case as pressure higher noted adi massiveness than are the scale and the diversity both are some issues or if he were to target arm monitoring or other kinds of activities one a implicit a goal of this workshop is that the community themselves will be a moderators are themselves so that is why this peer assessment processes kept a in and there are lot of incentives for collaboration good collaboration are effective collaboration practices throughout this arm just in addition to that end i had one thing i was able to see the thing i mean at least like insurance submitted the submissions they should bring some chance to reassess on all the feedback and give some kind of like a man that thinks it is we can know whether the participants really satisfying her not a sober are so after the first four weeks we can open those assignments back in the assessment phase and or if other people do want to reassess they can go ahead and do a reassessment for the arm for those submissions that is possible that it was an answer by kelley jones today
