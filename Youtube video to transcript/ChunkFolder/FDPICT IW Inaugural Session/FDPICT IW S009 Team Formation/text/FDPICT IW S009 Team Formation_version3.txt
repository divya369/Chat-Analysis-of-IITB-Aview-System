if you spend some time in deciding on the membership i must advise you on one possible problem i understand that some of our colleagues are not able to attend the session today many of them have indicated so by email however i presume that these participants were not able to attend are well known to at least several other participants in the a group that is working at a particular remote center i will therefore suggests that the team formation should include in even those people were today not present for some reason or the other if a particular person is absent of course that we will know from the attendance that is submitted by the workshop content but the team formation as far as possible should include these people in the exceptional case where nobody is familiar with a person who is missing such a person who is missing the session today or even tomorrow is required to interact with the workshop coordinator and get oneself abroad as part of one of the teams that team leaders therefore should be open to have one or two additions to their teams to this extent to retain the flexibility i would suggest that the initial team formation should not exceed three people wherever feasible of course i leave it to your own discussions that will happen in the first part of the lab session today so to recapitulate firstly you will form teams secondly you will identify the domain in which the teams are going to work now and subsequent the second part to the lab session requires you to work collectively on a link that has been given for the the woodlot debut in the first session you have to actually set up a quest that assignment is being uploaded so all of you can read that when you login for your lab session basically we want you to create a multiple choice quails in a particular domain that you have chosen for your team this work has to be done jointly please note setting up multiple choice questions to test the thinking and understanding of a student is not an easy job and that is why i want you to spend time working on paper and working collaboratively so if i am a member of the team of three persons for example and we have chosen the domain computer science or we have chosen the domain of electronics which is part of the electrical and allied fields then three of us will sit together and decide what should with a specific topic on which we should set this page then after choosing the topic we should do a paper design each one can contribute one or two questions and we should actually come up with a set of questions which will comprise the final quiz once we do this paperwork in the second lap session we have to work collectively we might be working on different machines if you want to but finally the team leader should ensure that all questions that you have decided that ways are put together on the demo dotnet thing and you just take one screenshot of the final quiz that screenshot will be uploaded only by the team lead one more submission that has to be done is that the team leader is required to submit to the workshop coordinator the members of the team giving certain details we shall be outlined the format will be outlined all of you are required to fill up in that format and the workshop coordinators are requested to upload
