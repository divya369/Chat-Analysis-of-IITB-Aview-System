all this automatically so he wrote this it he it was created with a government funds and so it was made available for everybody we of course so it was mainly created for matrix multiplication matrix manipulation in fact it has been optimized for vector arithmetic okay so if you have lot of competition for example if you want to do numerical analysis humidities linear algebra cigarrette chords its very popular in most engineering departments electrical engineering image processing a chemical engineering control purposes and own it is highly apt whereas for programming per say i would say python is a very good programming environment so i would say is it possible to re do the entire file up textbook companion you soar into python tucker another outstanding a language is julia jay you a lie a julia is a great programming language you can now read about it now did you ask this question let me give also a slightly different answer this may also answer the previous question for example somebody arse look this video is already available how do i used in my class there is a zero you you have come across i am sure that your been taught this flip method i think in the early part of this course somebody taught you afflict method a i have used the flip method for many years now i think it is the sixer ive actually done it seven times seven years five times for my postgraduate control course digital control and i followed the same method twice to my undergraduates first time i did for sixty students second time i did this flip method for herndon a thirty students in which i used my own video recorded courses study material integral control i created videos i left them similarly my other course which is process control undergraduate level first control course also i created several lectures and gave it to them and i told the students you must read and come to the class okay of course there is a question of students doing more work if you ask them again i have three hours of lecture i have created i let them you read the three lectures and come to the class also for three hours the students complain d one way to do three plus free six hours whereas in other classes i would spend only three hours in your course are to spend six hours this unfair i do want to do it so as a result we optimized the method but i can do is i can share that a paper i infact i would say it is a successful paper successful research study which appeared a cern as a paper on atripla international conference i would share that with you because unless you take care of this particular a perception of students namely they dont have to do much more work than other courses for example there was in fact a study conducted if i am not mistaken at texas aandm university for nursing students nursing students they did a flipped method and i and of course at the end of the cold they found that everybody had done well does performance was not better than other courses then they also ask questions do you like the scores most of them said they
