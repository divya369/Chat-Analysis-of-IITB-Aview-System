because wikipedia is an exception its an unusual the ten unusually good we are thats a reason on any topic if you say you do a search whatever be the search engine whether it is google validities microsoft whether it is yahoo you will see wikipedia entry on the first page no matter what application writers reached that level up and as a matter of fact no other encyclopedia can come anywhere close to this open source software wikipedia so this should be the ideal this be the goal for all the way your projects so in the meantime so what do we do we have to be careful but be careful about the veracity correctness of the material taught in that and of course if you take it from reputed people hopefully itll be good but even then take it with a lil bit of a pinch of salt that they could be something wrong if you are told unfortunately in some states there are no entrance exams for higher studies and it is based only on state boat parts and the students are in or told to study just from the book reproduce the book in your exam you will get two handed on to and you will get admission in medical colleges united admission engineering colleges in fact in some states children unfortunately dont even study the eleventh grade portion eleventh grade students come within one month eleventh grade is finished and they study the twelfth grade book for two years why they want their children to get toned down to unded so once they got the class got the engineering college your many people fail many people fail because in engineering college and professional colleges that method no longer works okay so these children are told to study from the book not to ask questions the faculty members also say no no dont ask questions he must mug you must be able to reproduce everything in the book now if he take that attitude obviously we are is not going to work you should ask his correct ill verify not only should we ask this question we should also ask our children why cant we say that doesnt matter you dont get admission doesnt matter but i want you to understand the topic i want it is the eleventh standard portion i want you to study that we cant be said so the answer to your question is why are topics could have some mistakes you should ask questions go to reputed people then such occurrences of mistakes could be less although not necessarily there is no guarantee that no mistake at all okay i hope ive answered your question a year and that means we need to be very careful even in na what information is right what information is wrong we need to verify it on the time and probably it will be taking little more time in our efforts yes i think it is worth it even from a book even in the book standard book there is a theorem proof youd understand the proof and ask are all the steps in the prove correct ride if you think that some sap is wrong then you know hey ino this fellow you hired will carefully this book amtrak would standard textbooks of course we have many local textbooks floating around which
