also that he is not war with inch thick to participate in the forum because if he becomes overenthusiastic the students may not open up a hand discussed so he should he should refrain himself are to be overenthusiastic in the discussion forum even though he wishes to share his thoughts and sand one more thing i would like to share is that he should monitor the discussion forum so that their discussion doesnt go haywire and i ate it like it should not lead to non productive or if not go in a personnel so that also should be taken care of the faculty member by handlers to reserve some of the thoughts i would we would like to share with you regarding flipped classroom a flipped classroom is definitely a good way we have been using it but we have experienced that while we ask the students to do think pair share effect if there is a classroom of sixty students and we have thirty pairs a faculty member to monitor what is happening whether the students are doing the right not so it was found to be effective more for tutorials where the number of students are less and we can individually both rudy each pair and see whether they are doing right thing or not so we found a flipped classroom to be more effective though it is still effective for large classrooms with it it is found to be more effective for tutorials then we also had the experience that the video that we would like to ask the students to see a priory the video should be a typical interesting and simple to understand if the video itself is rather complicated and if the video is not seen and understood by the teacher himself then it may create hurdles and the students may lose the interest because the url if the student loses the interest in the first place itself it becomes very difficult to bring the students back on track in the classroom the faculty should take utmost care in selecting the video and ensure that this video is quite interesting so that the students will come enthusiastically to tech participate in the discussion in the classroom so where is bank vaults in college it looks like you have had a lot of experience in using and implementing these techniques and your observations are really valuable so thanks for sharing with the rest of us i just have one small comment and clarification regarding the think pair share the goal is not necessarily that the teacher monitors what exactly each student does in the thing can pair faces besides if a if the thing phaser pair faces some students are so going wrong or something doesnt matter too much because by the end of the discussion by the end of the sheer face there lol come on board this is just a clarification that i like to make sometimes its completely okay for student goes wrong initially because its their thoughts so infact its better if they do something go wrong and then realize why its wrong in the sheer size rather than being told the right answer so that was just a small clarification but otherwise thanks for all your comments sent a one two five four to my question is that what is learning the dialogue video and how it is different from normal video okay the question is what is a learning dialogue video so oh and hows it different from normal video the differences very simple fact that we have inserted reflection spots in the learning dialogue window so if you go through the itee bombax videos it may end with thinner add some videos may end in a reflection spot some may have instructions in between post the video for a minute think about something then write it down or some similar kind of instruction where you have to actually pause the video and do something so all these are purposeful entries into the video so that the learner thus some application of the knowledge that if he or she has the same till the attack so this is very different from our normal video where it is only a one way
