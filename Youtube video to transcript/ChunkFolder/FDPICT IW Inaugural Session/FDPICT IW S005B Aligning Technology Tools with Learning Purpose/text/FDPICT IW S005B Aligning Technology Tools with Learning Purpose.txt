teachers jobs are not in any danger but the role may have changed so what used to happen fifty years ago was that knowledge and information were really very valuable since most people did not have access to it some of the people who did have access for the teachers so their role was primarily that of a bee in imparting information and so on now information is available so the teachers role changes from the person whos giving information to the one whos helping learners assimilate the information and apply it and so on so the role of the teacher as you may think of it traditionally may not be valid exactly this in the same way but the teacher is still extremely valuable and there are people they are human beings as decoration mention needed to help other human beings make sense of the information and apply it in meaningful ways i just recap what we discussed in the previous session or technology use has to be mapped to learning purpose focus have to be on the student learning for effectiveness of teaching learning in both online or blended scenario methods to improve effectiveness of videos online quizzes and discussion forums were elaborated in the previous session one more important thing that i would focus more one technology can be used at multiple levels in the revised blooms taxonomy so vedeo itself you saw that it can be used at multiple levels and da so this is where a lady videos we have used it at we call understand and applied levels the online quizzes we have used for assessment and feedback but are they are at cognitive levels recall understand and apply do focus on the learning purpose which is given in the text box and then we look that iety bombacks discussion forums it has four main learning purposes that we identified it is a broad at abstract level but it could be used at multiple levels a discussion forum can be used at multiple levels where you can actually start discussion on one flipped classroom activity or your flip classroom activity others comment on top of it you review it and in this process it becomes a new creation so the entire activity may change and you yourself may finally identify that a new flick classroom activity has been created as an effect of the discussions that has happened in the discussion forum so that is why we say that discussion forum can be used right from a record level to create level or if within the revised blooms taxonomy now are all we were discussing today and the first session was about a bee iety bombay ics platform for this particular one more important platform that youre utilizing a in the safety is the model and i specifically focus on the peer assessment the peer assessment aspect which looks at evaded level also specifically at and evaluate level and there is a wiki which is at grade level which we discussed yesterday the course portfolio was the example so ill be focusing a little more on the peer assessment process through this i will also explain so many people are having doubts on how to do peer assessment so the importance of peer assessment and review were explained by process on a moody yesterday morning i just tell you how it has been operationalised in the moodle platform so this is the technology use of moodle specifically that a workshop module within the model for doing peer assessment so what what is peer assessment in moodle it consists of just three simple set of activities first you have to assess an example submission which has been posted by the instructor only then will you be allowed to submit your response so this is your entry in the week one it is about peps activity creation so once you submit your tips activity creation the due dates seventeenth that us tuesday day after tomorrow or once you submitted in the evening the review process will start so when you look into your moodle interface in the evening this particular activity you will see you would have received four submissions to review just go through the details of submission so that our people are clear examples submission consisted of three examples submissions too from mathematics and one from a subject of web application each of them have been graded by the instructor so these are the grades given by the instructor for these activities and a detailed explanation of why each of these tips were good is given in the feedback first you have to go to this example submissions assess them individually once you complete it then you will have to see whether your assessment is closer to the instructors assessment that is the goodness of assessment so people can grade it this first activity seventeen out of twenty or a twelve out of twenty or even zero out of twenty but all those are farther away from the instructors assessment who the instructor has actually gone through the activity gone through the rubric and try to find a appropriate rubric levels that this activity corresponds to so your great should be somewhere closer to this particular score for example one so if you look at this example one and three are poor examples of our pieces individually they might have some good elements a virus this example to the tips euclidean distance is the best example according to the instructor so try to ensure that your assessments are closer to this typically in a peer assessment are there needs to be consistency among peers to provide you with valuable feedback and that is why you have to ensure that your assessment us closer to the instructors assessment so once you complete the example assessment then ah then it will ask for prepare my submission and then you have to submit your answer so the submission a window will have an instruction below which you have a title that have to give and also a place for text entry now the tips activity constructor document that has been provided it is only for helping you in this process this assignment does not allow file upload right now this is specifically done so that you will spend your time in creating the think pair and share so you will detail out the think pair and share out activities in the textbox so as an alternate you can use the tips activity constructor for developing the think pair share and you can copy paste what you did in the document to muddle submission please note that since there are large number of users many are due to bandwidth or some internet related issue might have problems submitting if you leave it to the last minute so i would advise you to go back to date art your home complete this assignment and submitted as early as possible if you can do it right now it is well and good if your not started it go to your home or in the remote center start this activity and ensure that you submitted before a tomorrow night otherwise on tuesday with many users trying to upload their submissions there might be problems offer submissions and we might not extend deadlines to a great extent this is just to ensure that people are on a same page they understand the limitations of are some limitations of the technologies that we are using please note the submissions are due on saber teeth so that brings an end to the session aligning technology with the learning purposes so for the next fifty minutes so we can do a queenie eye especially people who did not get a chance yesterday please raise your hand you can ask questions about the last weeks material yesterdays discussions and flipped classroom tips todays learning purposes about you creating your own flip classroom we try to limit questions two topics which will be useful for all the participants sober to each of you alerts visit centre one one zero seven overdue my question was regarding pink pair share activity when we are designing the coastal and pair can there be two different metaphors or entity to have a frequency of the quicker it will be a single question but with different part to be completed in phases okay thank you for your question so let me just repeat this sir summarize and repeat when we design a think pair share activity there are three phases so are they supposed to be the different parts of the same scenario seem question or can they be different so the main recommendation is that these phases the questions are the activities in each phase be linked to each other so the pair face has to somehow come i should link to the thin face that means what the students doing the thing phase should be relevant for them in the preface and similarly between the parents share phases so it is it is not a its recommended that you do not have completely independent think pair and share activities so one way to achieve this is to have a context or scenario or premise like curvy showed in the example yesterday and have questions all related to that premise in the three phases so there you can think of it as parts of the same question or different aspects of the same scenario either of these will work but please dont keep them independent because then the whole purpose of the activity a dozen get fulfilled center one three five five overdue my question is regarding them example assessment as i have seen the example in example one recent mistakes such as the time so not givin off thing disappear so theyre not mention i will assist on the basis of that thing but at the in their submission to what will i submit the rectified one on itunes i didnt get the submission that what web submission we rectify that with the correct thee in this example and then submit that or anything else can you elaborate on that thing the questioners are the part is when has a doubt that authorized swap just summarizing and refacing the western sudan this example submission are after the example submission there is something called up a prepare my submission for the connection between a example submission an my submission is not clear so shoddy should a participant revise the example submission and submitted or food the participant a uploaded a his or her own a individual tip a submission also that he is not war with inch thick to participate in the forum because if he becomes overenthusiastic the students may not open up a hand discussed so he should he should refrain himself are to be overenthusiastic in the discussion forum even though he wishes to share his thoughts and sand one more thing i would like to share is that he should monitor the discussion forum so that their discussion doesnt go haywire and i ate it like it should not lead to non productive or if not go in a personnel so that also should be taken care of the faculty member by handlers to reserve some of the thoughts i would we would like to share with you regarding flipped classroom a flipped classroom is definitely a good way we have been using it but we have experienced that while we ask the students to do think pair share effect if there is a classroom of sixty students and we have thirty pairs a faculty member to monitor what is happening whether the students are doing the right not so it was found to be effective more for tutorials where the number of students are less and we can individually both rudy each pair and see whether they are doing right thing or not so we found a flipped classroom to be more effective though it is still effective for large classrooms with it it is found to be more effective for tutorials then we also had the experience that the video that we would like to ask the students to see a priory the video should be a typical interesting and simple to understand if the video itself is rather complicated and if the video is not seen and understood by the teacher himself then it may create hurdles and the students may lose the interest because the url if the student loses the interest in the first place itself it becomes very difficult to bring the students back on track in the classroom the faculty should take utmost care in selecting the video and ensure that this video is quite interesting so that the students will come enthusiastically to tech participate in the discussion in the classroom so where is bank vaults in college it looks like you have had a lot of experience in using and implementing these techniques and your observations are really valuable so thanks for sharing with the rest of us i just have one small comment and clarification regarding the think pair share the goal is not necessarily that the teacher monitors what exactly each student does in the thing can pair faces besides if a if the thing phaser pair faces some students are so going wrong or something doesnt matter too much because by the end of the discussion by the end of the sheer face there lol come on board this is just a clarification that i like to make sometimes its completely okay for student goes wrong initially because its their thoughts so infact its better if they do something go wrong and then realize why its wrong in the sheer size rather than being told the right answer so that was just a small clarification but otherwise thanks for all your comments sent a one two five four to my question is that what is learning the dialogue video and how it is different from normal video okay the question is what is a learning dialogue video so oh and hows it different from normal video the differences very simple fact that we have inserted reflection spots in the learning dialogue window so if you go through the itee bombax videos it may end with thinner add some videos may end in a reflection spot some may have instructions in between post the video for a minute think about something then write it down or some similar kind of instruction where you have to actually pause the video and do something so all these are purposeful entries into the video so that the learner thus some application of the knowledge that if he or she has the same till the attack so this is very different from our normal video where it is only a one way the change we need to do in that ips activity or the question is what kind of changes if any do we need to do if the numbers are higher so ill have to think about this a little bit because of the top of my head i cant think of any very obvious changes that one needs to do are the reason is that i see in the think phase every individual is writing usually at that time the classroom a silent because people are thinking and writing on the road its the pair face wear rub this a lot of noise in the classrooms one thing is that please be tolerant of this noise its actually good noise its good because people are discussing their ideas critiquing each others ideas so even in the pair face i dont expect any specific changes from a to be done by the instructor other than seeing that look there are lot more pairs to where you may have to do something different is in the share face thats because how do you get a lot more pairs to participate in the share so there you can try some large group discussion techniques for example you can now invite pairs from the left side of the classroom right side center or the front and back of the classroom so in the shares you have to do some techniques to ensure that most or a large fraction of the classroom is represented you wont be able to get all the pairs are all the class members to participate in the share face but at least you can try to ensure representation from various physical locations in the classroom for the surface that is one possibility and there is one more thing in the share phase that we have tried so suppose you have a problem that has multiple valid answers and lets say these are some obvious or standard multiple answers after the pair face the instructor has posted these valid answers together on the slider on the board and just asked people in the share phase to raise their hands if they answer matched approach be and so on so share is one you to try some things are the other thing that we can try is if you can maybe the pair face go up and down a little bit to try to be more accessible to the various pairs so as you see if there are things you can try there arent any specific rules personally we have tried it in a class of about two hundred or two fifty and its worked its not been that challenging the first two or three time savannah both the teacher and students have had to get used to it but otherwise it has worked even in a class of two hundred center one one one one my question is is there any statistics or condition to be followed to pad the students in tvs are in peoples numb and you you told them you can format it mopar and flickr group if any statistic to be followed to form a structured group ask the question is about pairing and yesterday think weot taken this question again in the think pair share you can form unstructured pairs or unstructured group strategy does not recommend any specific statistics are shown when you are looking at more structured group discussions there are some recommendations i think we will take them up more formally in a two weeks from now but only a guideline that people have suggested is that the groups actually be heterogeneous in terms of a select group sweep more diverse whether its in terms of their academic achievement or in terms of gender and so on because its been found that heterogeneous group actually is able to contribute from multiple perspectives that shes one i can think of but will come back to this point more formally in about two weeks i am one more question whether this methodology induced the students to read books my user area ravana i havent come across any such direct study bird rehab center one zero nine eight my question is regarding here it is activity a the achievers of cricketing outfit declares all begun if they go in a mode that i have already done with the content then how to address this thing the question is if there are some students who are especially the high achievers they feel that i know this content have done it already what do i do in the tips so the first thing that youll have to do as a teacher is to design your tips activity so that is it is sufficiently interesting and challenging and this is not so easy because you also have people who are struggling with the content so dont make the tips is too easy because then the concern you have is more likely to be valid usually if you pick real life application context which are new to all students even the high achievers will want to solve it because its a new context they may know the information or the equations behind it but they may not have solved the problem so the problem itself is interesting they would do it the thinkfree is supposed to be easy to ensure that all students get into it all students are able to start the activity so you can announce upfront that nothing face is going to be easy and off for a short duration but the pears and cherries are when the more challenging parts of the question are there still nowhere in the latter technologies either active learning methodologies and then flipped classroom learning will be almost the most suitable further theoretical oriented company edit this in at in academic reviving the two part donated radical underground is a plus but the bigger the particular idol because a major role when your student going for her criticism but rather it may be but how this tunnel this we can implement further practical oriented subject either it may be the same assessment level learning by dialogue we can follow into subject are we want to implement some other new technology further practical subject in league so the question is immune to phrase what you said in the beginning is a question are these suitable only for theoretical subjects are also for practical subjects and lets let me try to respond in two ways are most of these techniques that weve been mentioning here are for classroom based technique or a combination of classroom and online the techniques we discussed here are not directly applicable in the lab settings it to some extent they are but they are in fact many many more techniques which people have research for the laboratory settings things like pair programming or learning by doing labs active learning labs inquiry based labs so there are several techniques which have been formally a there have been created and tested for the labs what weve been discussing here are focused towards classroom learning but having said that it doesnt mean that these techniques are only applicable for what your calling as theoretically oriented subjects also these terms are very ambiguous so whether you have topics which have real life applications or whether you have topics which are more conceptual in nature more mathematical in nature less mathematical in nature these techniques are applicable for a range of such subjects but the context of the setting is usually the classroom plus online setting these people where it has been implemented and video are where available the questioners are their example videos of the places available i saw that and today morning somebody has posted a video but weve definitely providing learning extension resources for all that we have discussed till now in the coming week so this is a sense we thought that it would be an overload we are not posted much of these videos in the last week now we will be differently posting this video we will post videos of people carrying out tips activities as well as we will post a few research papers which have experiences both home india and from other countries where people have tried it and they have shared the research results thank you for the suggestion center one zero nine three mom as you suggested that we should be addressed before the classroom to ensure that students are watching the resources before the classroom so should the result of the tweets be used as a summative purpose okay so the question relates to the quasar that as part of the out of class component are firstly the squeeze is something that you can do the squeeze in two different ways you can either have some short quizzes that students submit online before coming to class touch one way if you haven a learning management system or something equivalent or you can actually have a short quiz in class in the first five minutes of the in class component that also valid method if you use them for many people have used them for summative assessment but if you do use them my suggestion are suggestion here is to have a short very small a grade associated a small weight is associated with it dont waited very highly if you feel that it is not so you dont want to do it for summative reasons thats also okay but you have to see if then the its a feedback which is more important and see if that is working with the students so either our formative is okay but if its summative then let it hours smaller voltage you may find that term students are likely to be a little more serious if there is some weight associated with it even if with one or two per cent now my question is is where facilitator too fast as well as slow learner how we design tips for both learners to balance the class room environment or the question is how to design appears to address both fast learners and slow learners or no cheevers high achievers and so on are again this is one of the eternal challenges for most teachers here are only some suggestions which have worked for us again these are not rules and you will have to experiment to some extent with your own learners but the things that have worked are the tips he is an application type of problem which has three phases so you can actually have the three phases be of different difficulties we recommend that the think face not be too hard because we do want all students to be able to attempt it there is also the assumption or the prerequisite that students have already gone through a lecture or watched a video lecture or sat in a previous class and they know some of the information needed to solve the tips so the tips is not something that we are using to introduce a material at this point so if you can also make sure that students have this have done the reading or done the watching of the necessary videos that will help and within the tips itself have a range of levels that will help and the third thing which actually works remarkably well is in the pair face what happens is that students are teaching each other so even if you have to students of different term achievement levels sitting next to each other both of them do get something out of the activity also again there are some open questions where are they are good suggestions that people have tried and we will post this question also to the discussion forum center one three five to utterly on to share two point mom one is a question and adonis ive implemented the previous activity in my class i teach engineering chemistry feather was be tech students one extension of this devious activity what i can suggest the since we do this devious activity in the class when we are summarizing all the point and if viagra tudents do put up a write up it would be like the teaching them the love writing skills so that an abstract writing happens the debutant driven students more towards the technical papers because even students are writing a lot of technical papers this is what was one of my experience with java are the students have come a headband and summarize the type of activity in the class and when we asked them to list out everything they just gave it as an abstract so in this way it was helpful so i will i just wanted to tell you that this devious activity can be extended towards a was dragged away and another thing is the essence we are all aiming at this outcome based education and we are talking about daddys accreditations and everything how do these activities really helpers for the assessment of where are the results and everything now this is a concern because when we talk about this outcome based education and all the accreditation boards asking us to project data re assessment technique is really an a putting us into trouble like how we can address this particular assessment when you are doing such type of activities so i just have a quick clarification question before i respond to the second question you would like to know how to assess the topics that you have addressed in these activities is that what your asking or whether you want to evaluate how effective these activities themselves are yes in terms of results algoma cuz when we project the data if we are only confining it to assignments we are saying that when we do this activity we love you mark the assignments in terms of incentives but when were talking about introducing these activities into the curriculum the mapping desio peo mappings which are there in this outcome based the to that extent we want how these so i quit one enemy can do is a bit at the beginning when you design this activities start with some of your objectives whether its a course outcome of the module level or the program level and during the design itself as a teacher you can map some of these outcomes to some of these activities okay so this is gods will this disturbance much before you go to the classroom so and this is something you can actually show in your raw document in your mapping document that its not just the lecture component or the some specific assignment which is being mapped to an outcome but each some of these activities are directly being map to the outcomes that is on the frontend and the other thing is indy in any of the exam sluts especially if you have some internal evaluation so you can include questions which you have actually done within these activities so then you have a mapping between the activity and the exam question uyuni this two way alignment right objective activity and activit exam so keep the activity as your center and do this mapping before you do your design itself this will be related to constructive alignment results exactly mohammed and dual front you can recommend accredation boards for remapping for sin do outcome we will try we will try to ask professor father getting he has some say in the words we will recommend all of the sbc the thing is the reason we are recommending these activities is that there is years and decades worth of evaluation and research results behind these activities so its not something that we are coming up and saying that okay to this tomorrow there are scientific experiments done some of them are even controlled experiments they have been done in a variety of context that means different subjects different topics some are from western countries and some are even from indian situations so over a range of contexts subjects people are there have been several experiments done that show that such activities actually lead to better engagement a better learning or whatever the goals and most of the things or all of the things we recommend actually sits on this whole foundation of results as well as theoretical reasons why we are recommending them
