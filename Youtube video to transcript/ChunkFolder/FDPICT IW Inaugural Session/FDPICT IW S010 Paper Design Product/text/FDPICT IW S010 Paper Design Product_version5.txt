designers in fact okay and yes then what else users are government bodies and ministries engineers in municipal corporation boring thank your decision maker those were the same exhaust on example engineers a hormone incipal operations of thats enough we are just doing an examples of what im trying to do is not exactly solve the problem now cannot be cannot solve the problem immediately so all these roles that we have identified are people people like you and me okay ultimately were going to interact with people we are going to help people or we are going to seek some information from them should some interaction with people so please identify the people who are the people dont identify organization so the way i try to get answers from you when you do this as a team youre going to do the work as a theme for a homework problem which is the afternoon if your teammate is posing generic things like government organizations or say that municipality that is not an audience okay that is a non living object we are not talking about that we are talking about people so try to identify who this particular community of people are who want this information that is very very important okay so very good now a broadly a got the first step you do is to identify all this potential people and then the next step is to consolidate them so what we did was buy identified roles we called out all possible things although i dont have time to do for everybody but just as an example so we are called out all possible roles now the next step is to consolidate and under various groups so what do we do now you can organize them under various groups maybe all the students category can be in one group teachers spears can colleagues can be in another group professionals like doctors biomedical and manufacturing all these things under another group so broadly if you say there are three groups that has emerged from whatever we have got so we have students peers professionals so weve got students peers and professional so we have consolidated all these things under various groups so identify roles call them out consolidate under various groups so we have identified the audience escort the next step now you have identified these groups the next question you ask us what are their goals what is it that each of this role or reach of this group of people want to achieve one to achieve not in general of course they wont achieve several things in life not that what we talking about is what they want to achieve with something that you have essentially a web page is a way to communicate what you have what you can provide or what you are seeking for basically it is what you have or what you want to get in this case
