in the way which is different than when i will use the same presentation or the topic when i am talking to students so this kind of orientation will change for the same content also sometimes and thats where the structure of the presentation makes a very important a role in doing so let us take an example here ma if you all are there and ready for typing out something have a look at this slide you can see some alphabets on screen right now in the alphabets if i tell you that after a period of thirty five seconds of forty seconds i am going to switch off the slide unable to ask you tell me number of each of the alphabet are im in this set what i am sure i want how many age where their honey bees see when devan yes and all that how will you try to remember this set and re create it for me what would be the technique can you try out i will keep showing this lights what is the technique you use i dont want you to tell me the numbers right now i just wanted to tell me the technique what will you use in order to remember these alphabets and tell be back fits kind of a memory to suppose how will you do that are there some options ideas take a photo a kid we cant use technology by the way here i want you to give bear a solution which can be used for example if i give you an exam you dont have mobile camera that the time then how will you do this year try to construct a sentence okay create a story link okay how can you create a story out of this weak form words right so a series so you created a world called maggie out of it right okay let me create some words out of it i there is one option that you just count them then there is one a and seeks is to see and all that and then you can also bring it back white there is one option there is another option where you can create some words meaningful words right so this is one couple of words we can create and infact we can also create a sentence out of it what the sentence say a coincedence re merging unspent but tell me frankly hobby people can remember the sentence very difficult right so let me give you another sentence can you remember the sentence a coincedence emergent nursing can remember this when even this is very difficult eye or if i give you computer science and engineering will that would be a pretty easy to remember for most of you because they are associated with this department or at least they see this nameplate outside everywhere so its not a very foreign word for them like emergent nursing so it depends the structure depends on the fact of who is going to consume it you agree with this so it then it becomes pretty easy for anyone to remember now if i tell you tell with alphabets from this set and you will just say right computer science and engineering and tell me that okay all of these are the alphabets right now this is by the way a internet anagram server which helps you in doing this you cant write out some very interesting anagrams can be made out of it another example if i tell you remember this alphabets a mountain comic or account many ome or iconic mom nut very difficult to remember but if i tell you that this all makes into a world called communication thats pretty easy to remember
