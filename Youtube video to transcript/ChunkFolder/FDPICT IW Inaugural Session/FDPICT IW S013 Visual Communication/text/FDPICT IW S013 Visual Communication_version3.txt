moses with meticulous details then there is a high probability that it will reach out to the audience and communicate the way it is intended to be communicating right so far up typical presentation like whatever presentations you would be doing are now here i am slightly digressing i am not talking about the regular presentations what you make in your class for a particular subject and like forty series of lectures you prepare for that this may not apply to that set of presentations but overall the point is that we all love stories to whatever we do it is very boring if we dont have a story element in anything what we are here we communicate for example when i started with that presentation which had no color and very badly use fonts i suddenly had communication from all of you saying that we cant read it and that has struck my communication right now i am talking to you instead of you sitting there and listening to me and silently you are equally participating in this presentation and that makes my point very easy to communicate now i am communicating am not preaching like one person just saying something and other suggests a passive listening to it thats not the case so in order to achieve that we need a story in every explanation what were trying to make i dont mean that you have to always talk about be king and queen and all that but you need to connect with people with some interesting thing and what is the story typically so if you analyze that a typical film story goes like this we have the boy fitting the girl we have the girl is ignoring a boy and the boys trying to try something new there are some plots by the boy to get the girl and the plot will work and there is happiness ever after right below the standard story now if i translate that to what happens actually at the psychological level then it is the setup it is the conflict where a the ignorance happens there is a false climax where we try to see what plots are being worked out by the boy and there is action because the plot is trying to be made active by the boy and finally we have everything working out fine now if i translate this thing into any kind of a seminar presentation how it looked like shed start with introduction where you set up the problem okay this is this is the thing which are happening in the past now there are these observations that these the these are the problems right now around this topic and then there is this related work happening in this area so in between this related work we can see that there is a particular solution which we are proposing and we can show how this thing works by showing the results in proofs and finally we can say that this will work better if we go in this particular direction now this is very much a standard outline of any other presentation what you must have seen heard or made yourself and the why is that because this particular type of communication is typical talk outline which will be a pretty good story for people to listen they love to a start off with introduction because you cant suddenly come into action singer okay here is a problem and here is the solution nobody is interested in getting that therefore you need to follow a particular way of storytelling so that people will appreciate the way you have communicated your thoughts and it is only possible because everyone including students as well as a reviewers whom who are judging you will love stories always
