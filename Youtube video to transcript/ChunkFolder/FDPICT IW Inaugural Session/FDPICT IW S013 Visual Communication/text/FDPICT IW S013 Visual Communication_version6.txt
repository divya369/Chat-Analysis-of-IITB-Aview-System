because you know about this word in fact the presentation is all about communication therefore its very easy to remember this the point i am making forget about the anagram part but the point i am making is the structure will always be very pleasing for the users if it comes from their own domain so the moment it comes from their own domain the structure is very well appreciated by everyone who is listening to it seeing it reading it reviewing it whatever theyre doing with the structure makes any persoe you have to be contextual when you create the structure so that the users know what is it going to be for them i now going ahead we should be able to use the brainstormed ideas into various buckets of the presentation and that will give us a sort of chunking stage where our presentation we populated by all these topics which were discussed so this is one a simple solution and this can be done in a using a mindmap are typically when i teach this course in a class we have a full fledged assignment on a mindmap this time i decided not to go ahead with it are simply because of the time factor as well as the a end of our assessment evaluation are issues i heard about okay so we will go ahead and a now we will try to see if we can just know a little bit about mind maps so people who are aware of mindmaps i should just contribute bar by posting something about it but for people who are new to this idea it is a simple explanation using a central idea and a radial a way of explaining things so the subsections are radio like a sun rays he will have everything coming from the scent so later on you can decide the hierarchy by numbering it probably but it is not like a tree where you will have everything one below the other so its a radial design it allows you to express using visual so at times you want to show that is a very important you can put some stars are you can tolerate and all sorts of things are possible but if you add some of the concept my ideas to it for example labeling the lines which are connecting to the bubbles then it will become very informative by the way just as small exercise these are the mind my guidelines and they are written topic ten points here but instead of that if i show you this mind map directly the same guidelines are explained using this and this becomes more user friendly for people to understand so you can use a link you can use color you can emphasize and add images and you can have various dimensions to it you can use keywords and use of apparent over will help in giving importance there can be different styles you can have a personal style can develop from original sin which is available and all sorts of things so this is pretty easy to remember because of the structure itself as compared to this ten bullet slide this becomes very easy even if i have asked this question to lot of people later on and they are able to recollect a lot of these guidelines just looking at this mindmap as compared to the presentation slides right so let us move on but before that i think there was a a question in the last class which had given that what is the difference between the concept map and a mind map so therefore i suggest fertile ad one particular side a concept maps are abs
