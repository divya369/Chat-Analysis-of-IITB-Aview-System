is the a the boredom which accumulates over time so i like i said if your presentation lacks the engagement pointers in between so like if you see every presentation should have a point where the students feel connected to it in somewhere the other and that will only come through participation so if you are going to create a representation which has a monologue like you speak continuously on one side and dont bother whether people are sleeping on the other side when it is definitely stop people from derby it is observed and well researched fact that a students learn or anybody learns by participating so your presentation should have ample opportunity of participation and that will definitely connect them with this and they will never stop learning as you said so that is one sure shot way and the second wave in connection to what our presentation i just give is because of the a the kind of visual what you see on screen also creates the boredom at times for example if you see something very interesting then students dont feel like we are not part of it so every time you show something if it is a catching their eyes in terms of what heading your giving what all font sizes your used if it is too small people cant read it then they give up and theyll say its a very boring lecture and i do want to listen to it i would rather skip the slick so in order to avoid that method you have to make sure that you attract their attention to the topic youre discussing and then are you can ensure that it stays the same way by introducing participation in every presentation what your making the ride like to know that no there is lot of research happening based on the learning styles i thinker your showing us how the visual content is there any particular research done we ake a method like a model journal sagittarian can stick so no in general in india or anywhere across the country which kind of learners and more even though it is blended learning kenny or throw some light on this week a modern learning learning styles specialist okay so i will repeat the question for the benefit of others or what are the learning styles typically found in india is part of the question and i think specifically you asked about the vehicular be ah i am are really sorry but i am not very sure about the vehicle running part but with water experience i have a in teaching in the classroom as well as adapting to this side of a blended learning which we are right now doing so i am talking to a large crowd simultaneously and the books style of teaching where we dont even talk to people at all so the only way communication happens is through discussion forums so i have actually a just completed a course on a thready animation and which im going to do a formal announcement in tomorrows session but just because the topic came up right now i tried these three teaching styles in the short span of one year a last one year ive been doing this activity as a full time research and to see the pros and cons of all these things and one thing i realize is that without a personal interaction with learner it is very difficult to communicate or to establish a engagement level with anybody so
