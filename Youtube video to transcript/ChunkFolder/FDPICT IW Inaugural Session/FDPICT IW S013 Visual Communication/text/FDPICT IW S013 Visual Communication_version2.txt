but this only the research was prepared this probably will be able to see and explain what is happening otherwise if i send the slide to anyone they would not be able to see anything out of this right now when we see in terms of colour the same logic applies this is the classroom a scenario where slides are used but look at the colors and the contrast can you see this text which is on this gray and white backgrounds you cannot see white text on white so use of background is very important and at times your to take a very clear call about whether you require a background or not that is the thing that week i decided that will focus on these aspects in this small little module about visual communication using text and graphics while i would like to take you back to a smaller but very important component of a presentation which is the process and typically it should start with the planning phase where you plan a presentation i am sure it is nothing to do with your visual graphic sense but planning a presentation is very important after you plant then you can decide how do you want to execute it like what is the outline what are the details of a bullets youre going to add all that and finally you decide on the template which will allow you to change font color add graphics and other things right invariably what people do is follow the reverse process they start with color schemes and typography and i have seen people spending a lot of time on the front slide like what color should be choose what font should reward image should be added there its absolutely unnecessary amount of time is spent on that and later on they go to okay i think my outline is slightly problematics let me change the slide from here to there and then they go finally to the stage where they analyze oh is it really necessary do you want these number of sites here or should i delete them or sticks ideal condition is to start with a planning phase where you analyze and who can actually brainstormed ideas organize them go to execute stage and then finally to the prestige we will very rapidly go through the stages but a let me see if you have more questions i would like to answer them later okay now in the planning phase one of the techniques which i prefer is a about the ideation of the presentations what you want so when you we have seen have taken a popular example of a one of the most celebrated and most talented director india ever produce satyajit rai so for output or of communication what he wanted to create in a film called gary bury the kind of process he had followed was that in order to get here he had put lot of effort in the execute stage where he used to have my new detailed worked out and the planning stage was equally important very fussy his sketches and notes he has prepared on what the character will look like how will that correct behave everything is written in detail even the sideburns will be of this size how will that be looking so all these details are very well documented in the scanning of the documents which we have received right now once you have these things in place then if you put equal amount of effort at the time of execution when the shooting was happening used to go there and see to it that every character makeup is done to the perfection and only then the output comes out something like this which is world renowned and acclaimed for the finish of the product so i am saying that if you follow a particular purpose
