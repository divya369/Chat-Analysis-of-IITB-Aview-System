additionally generally considered as the knowledge but in the flip flop flip class concept you are asking that the information transmission is outside the class and assimilation is inside the class cohesion peter conti the curious statement so as you think about the various levels of knowledge and other many such hierarchies information is necessary but not sufficient information knowledge application wisdom you can go higher and higher sinformation is something which is necessary nobodys doubting the need for that but it is not enough just because information exists does not mean that assimilation has happened an application can be done by the learner so i dont believe this is a contradiction if anything what were saying is that information is something with todays reach of the very of the worldwide web or other sources information is easily available today fifty years ago information was mostly available only with teachers that is not the case anymore information is available so let students make use of whats available but it only information which is available whats not available easily still is their methods of problem solving feedback by experts and so on to that still valuable to be done in a face to face setting where either the teacher and the other peers okay lets take one last question and then we will give you a few brief instructions for the lab where you go and actually select videos or audio material and so on or websites for your flip class are so we will take one question how they are more instances for more opportunities available for questions so this is center of one three four five i do to keep the participation levels in the tgs activities i feel unique mary unite nash mercy she probably when we asked our basic freedoms depend of course we can expect almost preppy two section students will be in that activity but later on when they go for pairing i room pink show the people who are present oral who have done the thought process will be actively participating in the pairing activity and finally into the mast base when its repeated versioning page i dont think so the same amount of percentage of students will be having at that level so we can increase this participation a percentage in activities page by page okay let me address this question its a good concluding question to address now so the comment was at the number of people participating in the parents share phases might be lower can we do anything about it so firstly if you look at what happened today in your remote centers this was probably the first time you implemented tips in your own setting and the first time you will do it with your students also may not work very effectively and as a people who repeated this multiple times what they have reported is that it takes about three or four instances of repeating this activity which may be its a once a week or twice a week but after three or four times students also get used to the activity and the amount of participation definitely increases compared to the first one there are a lot of research studies published on this and we urge both attire to bombay and at some neighboring colleges we have done it in classes of two fifties or sixties definitely manageable secondly what you can do specifically to increase it in addition to sort of just do it there for times and a is explained to students why youre doing it and what you think they learn at the end of the activity do a little bit of debriefing as to what they learnt what happened what you can do next and so on and makes
