the engineering college faculties will be very much a given the training to use such facilities thank you thank you for a different perspective on this i will address where we are coming from at this point or fussy and i dont think the number of colleges or people were reaching is as low as one percent and definitely i agreed not hundred percent but technology infrastructure is growing the center is pushing government is pushing lots of children have mobile phones so one way of looking at this is when we have technology when technology is being pushed on us how do we use it most effectively so we are not saying you see most of the student community you are using mobile phones misusing their time ninety nine percent going to the other content which is irrelevant apart from their education pass so one thing this is how we know our students have these mobile phones we cant avoided so what are somethings we can do to make them use it for more useful reasons secondly if we want large scale outreach professor phatak also mentioned today modern technology is one way to get it we are not saying its the only way we are not enforcing it on anyone but most of you who come here your center what your seeing her this technologies there and what we are trying to do is to try to use it in a more productive so i do not about pushing technology or not its how to use the technology that is available the infamous activities that we win suggesting about active learning these are not new this or not modern these are some things which for several hundred years infact if you look at some of the ancient indian texts they look at the western takes at least for the past hundred years it says that let the students work on their own in class so you can for you have zero technology you can focus on those and still do something more than just getting students to listen okay will take one more question from the center then will move to one percent bn my equally we have begun out to one of the topics in then we started working on strategy and we get we ourselves we we got some doubts regarding this do you think we need to mention about the prerequisites before we start on a particular topic and we do is get during the course of its implementation supposed we come to know that children are now little more control than what we are expecting them to then dont do you think we can repeat the same same flipped classroom again and if we do like that do you think they get bored or do we have to change the complete context okay amy lets go little backwards in terms of the chronology of your questions that suppose were doing a tips and we find that students are not able to answer what we had set for what we do at that time so again these activities have a big advantage for the teacher in the sense it gives you immediate feedback about how much our students are able to do or not do so the advantage of such activities is not just for the student but also for the teacher so yes at that point you if you think its worthwhile telling students to go back and watch the video if you think that will help buoy head suggested if you think it might help for them to view some additional resources not the same thing they saw but something different which also might help them you can suggest that so youre in control here in terms of what you do next so you can mix and match these activities there is no rigid prescribed format
