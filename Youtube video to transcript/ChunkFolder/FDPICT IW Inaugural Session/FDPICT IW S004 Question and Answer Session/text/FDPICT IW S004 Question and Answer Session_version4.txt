as per your discussion we cannot repeat the topic if i repeat the topic others will get irritated and others will lose the concentration so that is a very serious so few comments here should be having a discussion here but i think this is really two or three important points about flipped classroom offers you cannot ensure that hundred percent of the students will be engaged hundred percent of the time and the additional point i like to make here is this does not happen even in a regular leech even in our regular lectures we dont have hundred percent participation we have hundred percent bodies if your mandate at attendance but you dont have hundred per cent of attend and attentive minds so hundred percent is not something that is realistic what doing active learning aims towards and what it ensures to large extent is that a larger fraction of your students are genuinely engaged in the content and you can read a few papers which say that look we found eighty percent of the students engaged eighty percent of the time it is in fact a fantastic number compared to what happens in a regular lecture however we cannot ignore even one student so some other suggestions have some other channels of communication open keep a moodle discussion going for people who need extra help have extra office hours so you dont need to get the other students irritated but you have we have to all use multiple prongs to try to address most of the students i think as teachers as the best weekend with a kid and yet one more question from my setup i tried a tested vicki and greg this is preparing for designing very spirit okay this question a offer of the information of other participants are asked this question is about can a can somebody write some up some scripts some programming script likes essays or other things for the wiki are yes and no yes because we are model is a collaborative arm a open source development platform and the specific biggie that we are using is a developed by open university in ukase which called oh ooh wiki so yes you can write scripts you if your familiar with the git git hub or other such development platforms all these quotes of the model a source code is available in git you can directly go they find the appropriate repository of the ohio becky a no you cannot do any custom scripting in the current model because we have control of this model and there are different levels of learners among yourselves so we dont want a too much of a buddhist variations happening across the weeks so we try to keep it standard so that everyone get up a basic experience of the wiki so yes the comment is well appreciated and i hope you do such activities because there are conferences for moodle alone the learning management system moodle alone has conferences like moodle moot which happens across different parts of the world there was one in india this year this going to be another next year so i think the community is very large and everyone is looking at teachers are rather than developers coming in and joining in are these moodle mood conferences job a dish that you go ahead and do such development activities thank you a minute i will think its a couple of questions from the chat window because theyre related to the tips and flipped classroom that weve been discussing a one question yeah theres a series of questions on how to do pairing in think pair share or how to make groups and to the end a instructor intervene
