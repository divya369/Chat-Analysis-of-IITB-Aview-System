i have been asked in the out of class segment so if you define a good learning objective for the out of class activity it automatically means those are the things that you need to assess or evaluate an itll also depend on what resources you assigned for them whether go to website to read this article so your learning objective is aligned to the resources you assign them which has to be aligned to the assessment but typically whats recommended is that you dont ask too many in depth complex problems only based on the out of class segment because students have not yet practiced them in the outer class part okay others one point id like to make about flipped classroom are sins again thats been coming up in chat or the idea is that you dont have to convert your entire semester into a flipped mode in fact its recommended that you dont begin like that if your teaching a particular subject which has many modules many topics and if you want to experiment with some of these techniques pick one or two topics pick one to begin with and do a flipped mode version of it then see how it goes refine your strategy may be to one more in the second half of the semester there is no need to convert the entire semester we write in the beginning there are people who have done that and thats fine if you want to do it its fine but its actually quite time consuming so start small get feedback from your peers from others was traded from your students and then you can increase the amount the tutoring center one one zero eight one to ask whether there is any interest and impact on the chicken for restricted access by my students my passion my institutional mechanics can create session selected kind a kitty angel ancient enemy and it had gluten extremist nutcases passion to create an institution there he asked the injunction institutional so do you have a learning management system in your institution something like model installed cheap are basically moodle is a free software you all you need to have a czar the downloads are freely available go to model dot org all your to do is downloaded but you should have a good support team who will manage the courses and a bird regular database backups and all those activities so as a days it is a absolutely free a only thing you should have people who have the know how of maintaining such kind of systems that is going to cost a little bit but we cant keep it restricted to monroe georgia yes a centre one three five five okay so my question is the concept described today how the flipped classroom so i feel that it is very much time consuming and considering the number of students i think that we cant totally ignore the traditional learning procedure if we can do an optimized learning procedure is that we can effectively combine both the traditional way of learning and the slit nozzle together we have an opposite way of learning procedure a complete dashboard my comment regarding this year completely agree with you sir and yes this is the same message that we want to give all other raw people its not just complete icity ah we want more people to a use blending modes that is why this workshop is the ag center one one zero seven ricky confusion regarding large concept in our education system are infants
