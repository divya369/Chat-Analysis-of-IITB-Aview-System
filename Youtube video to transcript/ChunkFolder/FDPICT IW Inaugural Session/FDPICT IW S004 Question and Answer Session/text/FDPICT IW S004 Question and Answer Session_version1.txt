the learning is mostly about assimilation and application the information part just happens at some point so giving a lot of new topics is not as beneficial as taking a topic and looking at it from multiple ways and solving many problems related to it and this is something you can even keep in mind for your own ditch so will start taking questions will do a few hendrixs first and then will go out to the questions we saw in chat so the first star center is the one three five five please question about this image as a group has to be unclear as to be an action coordinator account likelier voter opinion about certain topics chunk it the rehab team record decision documents like what they have not on the decisions you have to submit all these details are there to xindian moodle account so the activities the group activities we did today morning before lunch work for you to apply your knowledge to give an opportunity that there are no submissions required from those activities our goal of asking the workshop coordinators to keep an eye was to promote this activity was to make sure that there is sufficient the interaction between the participants so you dont have to submit anything from the mornings activities but there are some lab activities that participants will do later today afternoon in the lab those will need to be submitted and the instructions for those are present robin will be given will be reiterated at the end of the session now and then also be present on wood so no submissions required from morning sent a one two four nine and a question regarding class activity ivy active learning techniques are pin sharp are a parent share how to identify a specific topic requires other flirting sharma not all the topics can be done with the tips for example are problems with the multiple solutions can be a good choice for trips because russia activity can be done at a better way long to identify which topic require repairs in maya question okay okay thank you this is an excellent question let me just repeat repeat the question briefly so that everybody is on board or the question is how do i identify topics which are suitable for doing think pair share services which topics in fact should be choosing to implement thing peshat and as you noted center want to phone and not all topics are equally suitable to do thing passion so one quick answer is that or one quick resource this is not an answer but more of a resource if you look at the guidelines for think pair share which have been uploaded that contains some there are some recommendations on how to do so even afterwards you can go look at the guidelines but in a nutshell i think this is where they are the input of multiple people multiple thinking and rethinking inputs are actually valuable so as you mention if you have a problem which rick which permits multiple solution approaches it may be a design problem or it may be many more than one way to implement a program logic or it may be multiple solution approaches towards a similar final answer or it may be a problem which actually has no single correct answer but different perspectives are all valid in such a case is in fact a good alternative for a second place where you may try it is suppose you have a problem which is sought is complex and daunting for a student to do entirely on their own
