please consider a scenario that somebody threw your students have watched this video yep dunnock a session and support there are some concepts which have not yet been clarified or there are some additional concepts that needs to be clarified even apart from the video so consider a case like that and then start creating this video so it could be either a related topic or a completely different topic from what you did yesterday so ah the screencasts what it does or what should this videos it is essentially a video so this is one example so there were a this is a simple example of a using recursion so again this is something witches are related to computer science engineering abbott please ask a people who are not familiar with the domain please note what functionalities of the screencast you have used so it is only to get an idea of it there is some audio narration which explains the topic there is a continuous light movement and the writing on slides so they use the pointer so for example if you see and using this pointer right now so if you recorded this pointer movement is also captured so all these things get captured so only after noodles do not focus too much on the content that is being discussed but note the various things that this particular video a provides it is a youtube video you can directly watched from a ura remote center so points to take care while creating video it is same as what you did for selection of video over here but you have control so keep the length of the video to five to ten minutes this is because it has been found that shorter videos are more engaging the previous example if you look at it it is a bit long but since a one of the research scholars over here created for a lengthier self learning session there were specific activities it was chung done specific activities were given from that if the topic is too big for a single video ten minute video then split into two videos if youre presenting animation since you have a using a desktop or when youre presenting the animation it is better to use audio narration along with it rather than text so if there is text and video together they will be some cognitive load on the learner also over they try to use audio as far as possible and itll make the content a acquisition so the information acquisition much more easier now tools for creating a classroom videos there are several technology tools that can help you create a videos the tools that you can use berry based on operating system of your computer some of the common tools camstudio camtasia jing screencast o matic these tools have different features in terms of operation usage look and feel and everything so over here youll be eggs a using screencast o matic and record my desktop so screencast o matic is for windows users and record my desktop if youre a linux user so for windows users explore the screencast o matic tool is available for download over here there is also video tutorials before starting your rub a screencast do look at the video tutorial that is the browser should have the adobe flash player plugin enabled to watch the video or play with various features in the stool create some sample videos so at your neighborhood this is very important whatever you create today or just make sure that an internal peer review happens so even if somebody from a different domain
