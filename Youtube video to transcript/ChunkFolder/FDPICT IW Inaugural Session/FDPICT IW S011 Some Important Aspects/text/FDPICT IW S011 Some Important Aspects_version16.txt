age goes around twenty to twenty five per cent so can you k can we deal such type of problem while giving the document for turnitin oh yes and no you can simply remove the name of the author and the name of the institution are affiliation and submit that however let me tell you that the percentage that turnin ridden gives needs to be taken with a pinch of salt ordinarily unless the commonality is reported to be more than sixty per cent i would not bother too much so anything between thirty per cent to sixty per cent i would tell my student that look there is some some problem here please go back and cross check yourself but anything which is fifteen percent to twenty percent of course you would be very careful what this percentage is for example if the twenty percent is reported but the entire twenty percent belongs to two or three complete paragraphs outlining the major research findings which have been copied by someone else then i should be based on the head however is if it is because of such similarities that you mention its okay in general then you to take the output of the turnitin in a very in is slightly subjective manner you cannot take it just their quantitative judgement age let let us admit there is no foolproof mechanism of catching copy after all are we able to catch all copying done by our stood xiv examination so it is no different when it comes to results okay okay thank you thank you lets go to the next institution and for conducting a greater credit implement program read moreso be teaching fraternity and get ready benefited a knocker my question is related to the plagiarism i want to write an article or a research paper and i copy i take a few lines on a paragraph from somewhere else and i cite that paragraph now is it considered plagiarized material oh i have taken a reference on i have cited that paragraph or the one thing so let me explain the a view of the academic community if you take a paragraph exactly as is although you cite the referrals you must put the entire paragraph in double quotes that weiss that that will indicate that you have taken the entire paragraph as is without modifying it and then you see then that is not considered plagiarism but that is also not considered very good writing practice so if i have submitted a paper which as such we are four paragraphs copied entirely from some other place and have sight there that this paragraph is for this reference this paragraph is from this referral i will not be accused of plagiarism but the reviewer will prolly throwaway that paper saying that water does not seem to have applied his mind and he has not put the research findings of these four papers in his own words which is what is expected in a good recipe so i hope i am very clear no plagiarism but no value add in the research paper that i suck in general i must learn to put even the sighted thoughts of others in my own word in my own perspective that is what is expected when i submit an said i can take an example of a software engineering the definition of software engg seats are in software engineering applies a correction
