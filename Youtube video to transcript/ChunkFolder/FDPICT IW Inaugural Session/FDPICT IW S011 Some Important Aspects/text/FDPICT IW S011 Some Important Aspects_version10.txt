patients are encouraged we also encourage our students to submit on wiki because wiki maintains a comprehensive record of all the related things which are put together you will notice that the vichy submissions will permit comprehensive single collection of all related submissions if you read the grading policy the grading policy clearly states that in the course portfolio wiki the submission that you have given is also assessed and there are two marks portion assigned to that so you will notice that the lab session submissions as to marks and course portfolio wiki submission is to mark this pertains to the first four weeks that were conducted by process enabled the procedure a year and jack however the second component which is now ongoing does not have any proportion to wiki i hope that is clear thank you let us go to another institution i became his colleague iphigenie a this is regarding the plagiarism are essential in ipcc multi multi choice questions are we have to approach is generally one is what you are sober so have deliberated on ethical approach why country adopt along with this a technological approach like instead of only five questions i mean why same questions to all of us my different questions we can create a question bank and randomly a program that can generate different questions to different this will be probably a a a now a sort of a preventive method rather than a curative thank you very much for this suggestion to inform you there are some courses which we run where we do such randomization which is possible on the itee bombay ics platform for example a programming course which i run we get about ten thousand variations of every quiz question that goes out so even if there are ten thousand students attempting the quail nobody gets the same way it is not merely the a permutation of the choices but in the programming question for example if i ask people to analyze a program and ask them what would be the output of this program if input is a music would two arrows equal to four hour randomization scrape actually permits us to generate questions with different values of feminine and it generates proper set of answers with those value not only that if i am a student and if i get one quiz today and i answer that quite obviously the specific fees will be different from any other quail and tomorrow if i complained that look this is what i had answered i have a record by the bombay ics platform on what exact quiz was given to me so that there is no dispute such technological features are available unfortunately for this particular every ppi in the quizzes that we have conducted so far we were not able to implement such coding or scripting for randomization however to demonstrate your point and am very thankful that you raise this point let me use this opportunity to tell everyone else that the colleague from a famous college is raising actually very important point because later on when we use this technology for our students and if hundreds students are sitting in the lab they could be obviously copying from neighbors in the quiz answers graces are online quizzes i am actually teaching at this case one on course for the summer back in high demand
