you shall be implemented through an obligatory survey or all participants will be putting up this obligatory survey or obligatory feedback exercise every participant all participants all four thousand participants who have registered in his role and who have made any submissions so far whether they are continuing to engage with this every ppi further or not it does not matter even a single submission made and suppose i did not find time i was involved in some other activities and had to give up attending subsequent sessions of this every ppi still one submission that i have made i am accountable for that submission and therefore i must fill up this obligatory feedback exes there shall be set up on the model where every participant must i say that look i have that copy to be a silent period i state so my survey too if ive been tempted to copy the assignment then i will give all the details this will not be an anonymous survey because i must know who is a war however normally as you know woodell surveys are visible to many peoples number one the first thing visible is how many people have submitted that is the reason why making it obligatory for everyone to submit the suppose they are i i was tempted to copy and they were exactly a hundred people like me then those hundred people will only submit their names will be visible and everybody will know array these hundred jokers up its something that will reduce my self esteem we do not want that map therefore this survey shall be obligatory for everyone that means if there are four thousand and eighty three thousand five hundred whatever number of actual enrolled participants each one must suffer so obviously anybody looking at that survey will only see so many people have submitted all of them of course what they have submitted however will not be visible now here is a trick moodle normally permits teachers teaching assistants non editing teachers to look at the entire analysis and that ways to look at every individual submissions this also is bad suppose for example i was tempted to copy something i am in some remote center acts where i participated now as you all i have just mentioned i would not like people to do that i have done this but if i submit this survey and my workshop coordinator was to read it if ten other faculty members a unity bombay or teaching assistants everywhere was to read it i will lose myself so we are setting up a mechanism such that this feedback survey submissions will not be visible will not be visible to non editing teachers will not be visible to workshop work orders his survey results will be visible only to a small group of senior faculty at id analytics personal responsibility second we will never make public the detailed submissions that are given by individuals that is my personal prompts is because as i said earlier i value the self esteem of every individual and certainly that of a colleague but given this guarantee it is very very important that every faculty member participating in this evthe thus complete this obligatory feedback exercise and exonerates oneself even has been tempted or states very proudly that look i have never done this and i dont need to do is help me to collectively establish strong academic value this is something which is very very important i will conclude by saying that we as teachers are not only responsible to teach subjects to our sport
