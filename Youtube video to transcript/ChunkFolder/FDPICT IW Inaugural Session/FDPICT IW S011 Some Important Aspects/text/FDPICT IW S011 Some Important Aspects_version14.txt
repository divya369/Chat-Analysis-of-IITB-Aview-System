in an extraordinary job the second and less expensive mechanism of doing it is public acknowledgement and churubusco the tweance if there are a few students who do an extraordinary job publicize their names not only to the class but to the entire academic community of your department and of your institution believe me most of us are encouraged by public acknowledgement of some good work that weve done we have benefited tremendously by adopting this approach amongst our schools community nighty i see no reason why it will not work with your community in fact there is one additional suggestion that i would make in terms of conducting flipped classroom more easily in institutions which largely run undergraduate program and therefore they do not have teaching assistants in the form of emtecs students amy stools or pdi studio i this is still benefit from the presence of a large number of puzzle stools now let me tell you this notion that teaching assistants must be either postgraduates or pay the student is not entirely correct while we should have such people but in colleges where such senior students or researchers are not available it should be perfectly alright to try another mechanism of getting teaching assistants and that is from our own undergraduate community and let me tell you this is not hypothetical in i te bombay in addition to m taken padi students we ordinarily deploy third year or fourth year we take students as teaching assistants for our core courses that they are selected on the base of applications they want to apply for a bean age and they participate in conducting lab and they participate in conducting flipped classroom session in fact the summer course the time teaching she is one woman i have a forty days from amongst the applicants were all be tech student we take second a third or fourth year student and who work with me to help me conduct this flipped classroom sessions for more effective because as you can guess its a people intensive tasks have to engage with my students in discussion and i cannot do it alone now this has not been tried by most of our colleges namely trying to involve third year and fourth year be tech students as undergraduate years for my coworkers i would strongly suggest that this be encouraged because this has given great positive results they have been situations in eighty bombay where some of the better these are not why im take or pay the student but are the third or fourth year undergraduate student yes somehow the firsty rights relate to them very easily of course this cannot be done for all the undergraduate course particularly when im teaching a third year course then at worst i can take a fourth year undergraduate ridgity in eighty bombay there is an approved procedure of pain a tear shape to such students for the entire semester the amount is not very large but that amount works as an additional incentive for senior be tech students to participate of course there is an extra work that i have to do as a teacher for example at the beginning of the semester i have to conduct a training session for the stage informing them what is flipped classroom and how to run it and then for every week or two weeks or three weeks of portion i have to actually discuss with my students what are the problem that i am going to consider in my flip flops
