we help you out in the design it has specific guiding questions and comments on how to do it it also has example submissions so we have put up examples slides which can be referred to while designing your own flip clasp so all these resources that we have all the slides of today will be available in moodle by end of are today without much ado will start moving onto the flipped classroom activity construct a so are some important points about the activity construct if you look at the bottom you can see by ascii so all these documents are shared to what is known as a creative commons license this specific license means that it does shed a light it and used by a poor are different purposes as long as you give attribution by channel and we attribute this attitude that this is from a faculty development program conducted by antibubble are thats all would be required otherwise your own free to use this particular slides wherever you want to use maybe another session that you want to augment your students or your colleagues your feet used so throughout this workshop one more important concept that will be focusing on the concept of open educational resources whatever resource you create it has to be open so that other people can also take the benefit provided they give you some attribution so there are various creative commons licenses are a we do not have enough time to explain today but try to go to the creative commons dot org to see alot of different types of licenses available in case people were not listening to me ah this is a creative commons share alike license it is important because it allows the work to be shared among a lot of people and it is a open education resource so about this constructor this activity constructor is aimed at assisting teachers in designing flip classroom activity in their own course using existing content so rather than you create new content you look for existing content and try to create flat classroom activity based on this guide will deal with open educational resources or those licensed under creative commons there are various kinds of licenses please go to the website of creative commons and look at what all each license means a general guideline the slides with these white lined background or information sheets or they give you guidelines or possibly information chunks that you want there are some more slides with pale yellow or brownish background they require you to provide inputs so that is where you input a you provide your own input so there are texts written in blue you have to replace that whatever you want to input while design such blue or yellow and blue combination will be followed by an example so the first segment is about you where you have to provide basic information about yourself and the topic in which you want to design the flip clasp so this is the yellow slide the pale yellow slide that we were talking about so here you can see text written in blue so will be provided adding this constructor to you and what you have to do is replace whatever is in the blue slide with appropriate inputs so this instruction says replace header with knee the first textboxs topic chosen for flip classroom the second is about course from which the topics chosen are the third is the domain target audience and this is actually a optional if you want to put up your affiliation you can even put that so ill just show you an example i have created this site so you can see example written over here instead of name you can see my name this particular flick classroom example that i am talking about is about a small topic called boolean expressions which is common which is a common to both electrical and computer science faculty ah ive taken it under a course called digital circuits which comes under the broad domain of electrical this targeting second year uci students in electrical engineering suave specified who the target audience is now in a flipped classroom there is something called out of class segment so a this section will help you in designing the out of class segment are todays lab activity is specifically in helping you out a hint a doing this out of class segment so youll be using this flip classroom activity constructor in the afternoon about the art of class segment it is out of classes meant mainly for information transmission to student mostly help achieve lower order cognitive levels in na bloom stalks revised blooms taxonomy called a recall understand and apply level teacher has to take some time to search and locate appropriate videos for the first time when you do it you will need some amount of time to search and locate appropriate videos for your own course are one important rule of thumb out of class activity should not be too lengthy for this particular faculty development program we have given the instruction ideally think of one lecture being transferred outside so one lecture typically in colleges is of duration one hour so your videos and associated activities should not be more than one hour duration should not make students do more than one hour of work so this is the first input slide that you have to a workout listen to the instructions that are being said now so that you can fill it in the lab session will give permission to download shortly first you have to write the learning objectives of the out of class activity and as the guideline says typically provide learning objectives at recall understand and apply level another important thing what are the key concepts that you want to cover a through this particular out of class segment are typically the number of concepts should be very few utmost so one to two was the guideline maximum you can go initially yes three so we know it is difficult to compress everything are the first time around so this is a starters sheet so here at the max you can go to preconcepts so look at the example that have written this is the learning objective of the out of cloth this activity will talk more about these a levels and other things to morrow you have been already assigned three videos for tomorrows session so session one tomorrow is completely about how to align the learning objectives with appropriate a technology tools what is important to notice that have only used three key concepts so all my videos are related to these three concepts now guidelines for video selection first you can check the national repositories they are entitled and petals youtube channel you dont find any content in this there are international repository is like we are commons open courseware consortium or open learning initiatives which have courses free courses online courses and if you dont find your content over here then look into the video standard video repositories ideally you should filter for creative commons license so with your youtube search or a vimeo search you have an additional component called filter choose this filter and select the creative commons license it is important because some of these videos have copyrights and if there are some copyright violations you may be legally obliged to pay some financial compensation that you me the party a whose video has been put up they may file a case against you so in order to avoid all these that is why we always insist on this open educational resource all these are open educational resources are particularly the we are acid w and oily so the moment you create a creative commons license for your resource thereby you reduce the legal complexity in sharing your content that you create so go to youtube garage youtube education there is a vimeo vimeo also has an education channel and if you dont find any of these there is worldwide web ah there is a site called edutopia which has a list of open education resources websites you can even look into that a normal google search for open education resources in your subject and that is why this key concepts are important these may be the search terms that you put up in the youtube search or the google search some more guidelines to keep the length of the video not more than ten minutes there are empirical evidences are with says that shorter the video greater the engagement if you find that videos are too long lets say you find in petel video which is of one full class are what we would want is split the topic into multiple videos so provide timelines where the videos can be split and chunked one more guideline are the videos are ideally select videos which have both narration and text so that concepts would be clear to the students so this is what you have to fill the main video source you oral provide the you are lower here the license what kind of license is it if it is a copyright a specific copyright then you have to say that it is a copyrighted video and you can map each concept with the appropriate video segment she can provide the start time end time and duration in minutes so this will help you in shortening the videos and at the end of it provide the total duration of the video so if you look at the example that have filled you can see that i have shortened the you are so ive given up did not tell why you url so that it is easy to remember ah the license is easy by essay with reuse aloud and have mapped each of my key concepts with the video segments so i had a total of forty five minute video skype looked at a complete session lecture session by a other instructor and have actually split into videos so none of my videos are going beyond seven minutes initially it is very hard to find smaller chunks so porous starter this is advised but as you go proceed as you gain expertise it is important that you reduce the video length two summer around four minutes youtube vimeo all these sites also have these are filters where you can select short medium or long videos short video as per youtube and vimeo is something which is less than four men are medium lengths a comes in we knew it is approximately ten minutes and longer videos are greater than ten minutes so er guideline while you do a widow selection is select chunks which are not more than ten minutes initially another important thing so if you actually look at the videos that we have posted in iety bombay eggs every learning dialogue video is followed by a learning by doing activity and you can see they were like two or three learning by doing activities associated with a video and each of these assessment activities are aligned to the learning objectives and are at lower levels so it will be some content which was already discussed the levels of questions is not more than apply so it would be either simple recall maybe a little bit about understanding what the instructor said or what the video sent at the most it is application like for example we would have given scenarios there is this flip classroom scenario eh this is the flipped classroom scenario be which one is better so these are only application kind of questions that we have asked you so again we would recommend you to follow the same it is important that there is some amount of assessment strategy that is aligned to these out of class segment and you can put your video plus assessment the total duration should not be more than one lecture hour so over here learning objective what is the assessment strategy expected duration in minutes and if there are some additional instructions you can provided if you look at the example for each of the learning objective that have provided i have provided the assessment strategy and have also provided are the instructions so the total activity durations thirty minutes for the expected duration is thirty minutes and this along with i had another thirty one minutes for my video watching so total is one hour one minutes that is fine it should be around one hour you should not do not exceed more than one or are you have already looked at this there is something called inclass segment where you have to decide what the active learning strategy yes make sure that your in class segment contains activities for effective learning by this we mean active learning strategies in active learning strategy the student will go beyond mere listening copying of notes or execution of prescribed procedures like problem solving coping the what the instructor salt in the boot students are required to talk as you did during your pair per phase write and reflect as you did in your thin face and pair fees and express their thinking as you did in your share face it has to be the activities have to engage the student in higher order thinking skills so if you happen to look at the pros and cons analysis activity that you did in the morning it actually there were some trigger questions and you had to think a lot more than mere application of these quests you had to completely analyze what the flipped classroom strategy he was about and identify one pro and one con and then discuss with your participants so this is what you mean by higher order thinking it goes beyond mere application you have to do some amount of analysis you also had to do an evaluation which strategy was better or sometimes they may be creation level activities but not always typically in engineering problem solving they are design are problems which can lead to the street level activities another important guideline ensure that students get feedback on their work either from peers or you so during your pair face you obtain feedback from your peer and during share phase as instructors we looked at specific questions and comments and we provided our feedback as a summary and that is also another important point ensure to provide summary that connects out of class and in class activities so remember what we said about the entire exercise so be had obstructed the entire exercise of flick classroom that we have done till now and connected both the out of class videos and the inclass prosand cons analysis activity so you should do similar oduce a summary in yourown flipped classroom strategy so that students understand clearly why the out of class activities are important and why the in class activities are important and how they are connected so a inclass activity design again you start with the learning objectives and key concepts so in this example the learning objectives have been stated another important thing both the learning objectives are at analyze level the key concepts also vary over here i am looking at real world problem solving virus in the videos it was about simple expressions then if you see another important is the activity design you have to state the active learning strategies that your going to do its not just that within the active learning strategy what the teacher is going to do and what the student is going to do across the entire loan strategy and finally you have to justify why the above active learning strategies truly active we have to give specific reasons as to how the student go beyond mere writing a listing or to lecture and although things and have to specifically say why this activity is going to engage them in higher order thinking if you look at the example that is given are the active learning strategy that is are in the example have used the active learning strategy of think pair share as well as a peer instruction have actually mentioned what each of the strategy is going to be useful think pair share for real world problem solving and concept clarification we use peer instruction so are these are peer instruction strategic questions now i am just explaining the tips strategy because you have already come across the think pair share in other video first we provide the premise or the real world problem that we want to tackle over here there are these poor sensors each sensor has a temperature a temperature and humidity sensors sensors one two three four ah this is located in a big agricultural university and there is a central hub over here and they want to take some measurements ah you have to assume that a okay yet assume that each information is passed as a digital signal and there is a digital circuit that is kept at the central hub will be looking at the think phase question assuming that the temperature and humidity of a station are two boolean variables a te an edge as given in the figure think individually and identify the scenario in which a high output will occur from an area if you look at this question what the participant has to actually look at is identify one possible scenario where a high output will come and this is actually doable for that particular target audience so they would already be primed about how high inputs would be coming apart all should be stated as high input so theyll be able to think about this task and most of the students will be able to do this think activity in the pair face again you have been given a question and what does selects sensor output based on time are using two variables there are two other variables a and be and there is the sensor outputs that common or develop a boolean expression to combine time selection and output selection so they have to actually do something beyond just mere thinking pair up and compare your answers agree on one final answer and then do this particular task so its not just comparing the answer they have been given one more additional task so think face had them to write what will become high so that was a deliverable output now it has been connected to the pair face and in the pair face also the level has been increased and as a pair they have to come up with another out and finally in the share face the instructor asked the group to share their answer with the class and see whether there are different dances soup since a the class might be very large so instructor takes one answer then ask others to see what all are the different other answers that are coming in so that all the answers get shared and after sharing is done instructor gives feedback on the correct solution and how minimizations using boolean expressions play so there is this application of a concept in this particular topic and he summarises about how this concept is applied in this question and what all are and he connects it to some real life applications like multiplexers so there is some other real life circuit which actually does all this so hes connecting this current knowledge too what is their a in the future a chapters of this particular course again he does another iteration too off find a implementation and other things with this is how typically if you look at the think pair share each of this is followed up characteristic is that it is a doable task at each level correct difficulty there is a standard of what is a deliverable output that is demanded from the students at each phase and thereby engaged the students in the task and have justified why this is an active learning strategy towards the end she will be provided with this during the lab session were will give you specific instructions are you will have to complete the inclr segment of the slip classroom activity constructor a during todays lapses which comes in the afternoon are what will do now a jacket a flipped classroom activity construct itself survive enabled the download this presentation so you can also download it within your arses arm in the lab in the afternoon will focus mostly on the out of class component in the next half an hour or so will actually focus on the in class components which you have already seen to some extent in the last one week so to begin i just use this activity constructor to help you format or organize the activity lets go to slide four so the first part of what you need to do now is to actually get ready get primed to create a flipped classroom design for one of your own courses that will be teaching in the coming semester or one big goal for us for this faculty development program is that you not just learn about these new techniques or get familiar but actually create materials which are bound to be practically useful for you as soon as possible when we run this course during the semesters we actually ask the participants to work with a topic that they be teaching the following week go implemented comeback and give us feedback so that may not be possible now but at least we want you to create assignments that you use very soon so inorder to do this the first thing you will need to do for these activities find a partner if you look at the next slide slide five you have to fill in the topic chosen for the activity the course the domain target audience you jpg which year affiliation and so on so you must try very hard to find somebody from the same broad domain and try try if possible at all to find somebody who teaches a similar course the closer the topic for you and your partner is then the easier this activity will be so quickly just check around in your remote centers and try to find somebody with whom you think you are able to write a common set of fa responses for the slide for the topic and so on so would give me about two minutes to do this get up walk around ask people a same domain definitely and preferably cim course this is a pair activity and then two pairs will join and do some more things to you you cant work on this individual as soon as you find a partner please fill up this introductory slide so write down the rapid course domain you can actually go bottom up whats the domain you can you dont have to put the affiliation right now but whats your domain whats the target audience course and so on and start filling out this introductory slide because this sets the background for both the lab this afternoon as well as the up coming activities so currently you can write it in your notebooks if you do we actually are when alton the slide so make sure you write it in your notebook and find people from similar dimensions were in the same or more center and you might be familiar with other participants over there ill be quite easy we expected it would be easier full at a broad level find people from seem to me we really hope that you take advantage of this surface to face part of the blended course during the online sessions your all separated in time and distance your working at homes or offices on individual pcs or laptops so now that your physically together with somewhere between five and maybe even a hundred participants in your are simplistic advantage of that
