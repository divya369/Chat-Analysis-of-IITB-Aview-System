there are these poor sensors each sensor has a temperature a temperature and humidity sensors sensors one two three four ah this is located in a big agricultural university and there is a central hub over here and they want to take some measurements ah you have to assume that a okay yet assume that each information is passed as a digital signal and there is a digital circuit that is kept at the central hub will be looking at the think phase question assuming that the temperature and humidity of a station are two boolean variables a te an edge as given in the figure think individually and identify the scenario in which a high output will occur from an area if you look at this question what the participant has to actually look at is identify one possible scenario where a high output will come and this is actually doable for that particular target audience so they would already be primed about how high inputs would be coming apart all should be stated as high input so theyll be able to think about this task and most of the students will be able to do this think activity in the pair face again you have been given a question and what does selects sensor output based on time are using two variables there are two other variables a and be and there is the sensor outputs that common or develop a boolean expression to combine time selection and output selection so they have to actually do something beyond just mere thinking pair up and compare your answers agree on one final answer and then do this particular task so its not just comparing the answer they have been given one more additional task so think face had them to write what will become high so that was a deliverable output now it has been connected to the pair face and in the pair face also the level has been increased and as a pair they have to come up with another out and finally in the share face the instructor asked the group to share their answer with the class and see whether there are different dances soup since a the class might be very large so instructor takes one answer then ask others to see what all are the different other answers that are coming in so that all the answers get shared and after sharing is done instructor gives feedback on the correct solution and how minimizations using boolean expressions play so there is this application of a concept in this particular topic and he summarises about how this concept is applied in this question and what all are and he connects it to some real life applications like multiplexers so there is some other real life circuit which actually does all this so hes connecting this current knowledge too what is their a in the future a chapters of this particular course again he does another iteration too off find a implementation and other things with this is how typically if you look at the think pair share each of this is followed up characteristic is that it is a doable task at each level correct difficulty there is a standard of what is a deliverable output that is demanded from the students at each phase and thereby engaged the students in the task and have justified why this is an active learning strategy towards the end she will be provided with this during the lab session were will give you specific instructions are
