but when they happen the penalty is very harsh i was quite surprised that why such things are being detected from amongst teachers because we are not dealing with student reducing with teachers but then my colleagues told me that part that human being is a human be after all where youre not tempted to copy an assignment when you were a student i said yes i did then when you grow what is the reason why you will not give into that temptation if the chances are bride that you will not be caught so i grudgingly agreed that yes i might fall to the temptation however i still hold that as a teacher we have a greater responsibility to demonstrate higher value and we cannot demonstrate these unless we imbue these valves ourselves to the perfect since it is entirely possible that we might be tempted because temptations occur in life are a variety of reasons that is the reason why i thought of an alternative where i requested people to give a feedback admitting early in case they were prey to such temptation and they mention exactly what they have copied and tom who i was again surprised that more than two hundred people more than two days participants have actually confessed that they were free to guests while i feel sad that there are so many teachers who fell prey to such temptation i also feel now that the same to a hundred people had the courage to come forward and say yes we did that it was a mistake yes sorry will not repeat it believe me my dear friends it requires tremendous guts to admit a mistake to commit a mistake is relatively easier to admit a mistake and to corrected joy complement all those two hundred plus friends wax showed the courage and i am sure that they will never ever permit themselves to be tempted like this in future i would suggest that all others we have not indulge in such practices should know the temptations in life can occur any time not necessarily now they may occur next year they may occur year after that particularly when many of our faculty colleagues are pursuing their research many are working they piously on research work with the research scholars several of our catholic teachers are actually themselves doing bsdi and many others would be soon followed and that is an area where the temptation to copy material from somebody elses work is the treatise you might have heard that very recently a vice chancellor of a university in puducherry was caught doing this plagiarism it was the cat was cat caught last year she submitted her resignation but did not submitted properly shes now been removed forcibly that is the downfall my dear friends that may occur if we fall to such temptation it is therefore very very important that we uphold these values and once again i will say that while i feel sad that so many of our participants were tempted but i feel immensely proud that they had the courage to come forward and say yes we made a mistake and that it will not happen in this context i would again like to mention the importance of open educational resources on which you have had a large amount of discussion earlier couple with open educational resources is the matter of open source
