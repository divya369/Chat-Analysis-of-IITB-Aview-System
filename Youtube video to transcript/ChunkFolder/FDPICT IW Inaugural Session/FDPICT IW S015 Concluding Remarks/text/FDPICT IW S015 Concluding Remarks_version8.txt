note that this is done as the first task today in the afternoons whenever you exchange messages through email as i already mentioned you must standardize on what should be the line in the subject that will mention uga invariably when we read our email the first thing that we read is the subject and the subject is black are the subject is arbitrarily return that were not able to correlate what will be the end the email itself should be short and brief but succint and carefully written people think that they can afford to write bad english in an email only in a document which is to be formally submitted which is the properly word process they should take care of correcting all grammar and spelling mistake that is not correct even in email communication has to be as perfect as a document that will prepare mistakes can happen even i make mistakes but i will tell you a habit which have developed even if i write a slightly longish email having two paragraphs i never press the set button unless i have read it at least once completely and carefully and try to see whether there is any spelling mistakes in grammar then only i praise thats it but this is a discipline that we must himself and this discipline must be visible amongst all the team members who collectively interact through emails the second important thing about the communication is that you often have to exchange documents images video clips or other material that you are preparing as a component for your team is and what should be the format of such files at what should be the names of such file naming conventions in fives are extremely important because otherwise they could be a large number of files with very same or similar names causing confusion as to what does that file and you have to evolve a file naming convention amongst the team members so that wherever you attach fights everybody will know from the neighbor the file itself roughly what that file should be the format in which the data in that file should be stored should also be pre decide for example if it is to be an editable text file such that i prepare that file and a colleague of mine on the theme might have to modify that file type then the file has to be editable to fit the text file you may decide whether it should be a dot creates the file it should be a dot odity five like open document format for a open source rub what process or it should be a dot doc file for microsoft word a word processor to be you my request is make sure that if you decide that all editable text files will be taught dock or not dockets fights then make sure that all the members of the team have access to legal copies of microsoft office if you do not have access to legal copies of microsoft office you pet park use that software to edit those fine period it is blasphemy it is a criminal offense and we will not commit crime anymore in the worst case use ordinary text files it is perfectly far better still use open source what proves of course if you are more comfortable with microsoft or any other proprietary package burdened by the lies and then use that much but shes nowhere tofu but a team effort suppose there were four member the of us have let say software license for the best package for photo editing because we might be working on creating some engineering drawings or photos
