you do is entirely your own work a small team of people two to four people will be doing that work i will say this again there will be additional description by the way of what your to submit your submit tags for example did i mention tags that are to be submitted along with the we are that you give these are the tag which are words or phrases which yet be used as a parameter for searching so if i say thermodynamics for example then if thermodynamics a tag on any of the wee hours when i search thermodynamic all twenty two years pertaining to thermodynamic sure okay i will explain about tagging in the next weeks the activities but you will have to create such tax twig you submit data and creating tax has to happen while you are creating the material itself de historical capture of activities automatically happens on books platform all the activities that you been doing on haiti bombay exe for example are wrong call activity logs are there who saw which video when is law who attempted which pays well is long and will now be doing a downloading of all those event log that gigabytes of long and will be writing programs to automatically analyze them to learn about the statistical behavior of the parties however what is not long is the individual diaries for example how long i spend in thinking about a topic cannot be captured online where we set an email that can be captured when email was said by whom what was the subject of that email is know what was the attachment to that email is no and that is how once you start creating digital records it will be easier for you to ensure that your diaries are properly written girls all the timings at should be kept but please note that digital capture will only be capture of an event when it occurs that capture or that event log can never tell me the total time that an individual a spell on an activity and that is why while such capture is important writing your diaries is equally in this week you will get progressively worse will get some material describing how the a collaborative work is done you will have to look at some websites to which suggests how groups can collaborate but oh its the middle of this we are perhaps or a thursday i will upload an additional a pdb file which will give you our thinking of what should be the diary entries that individuals should rise and their diary entries that the consolidated diary should be submitted by the team leader you may take that as an input which is the format in which you will have to submit but that will come only on thursday meanwhile please remember every one of ways to record any activity that you do now after today evening which goes towards the team effort even if you spent that needs some time in thinking about an idea and jotting down a few things and then send an email you must have a record when you spend that time and what activity would as i said
