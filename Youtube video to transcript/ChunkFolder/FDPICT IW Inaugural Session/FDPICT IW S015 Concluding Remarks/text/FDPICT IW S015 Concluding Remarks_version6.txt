this set of video lectures explaining some cans some team might decide to design pieces with questions answers and explanations some other key might decide to give the description of a possible course project that can be done in one of the sub domains of their home as long as any work that is undertaken is done with an intention to provide an extremely good quality useful resource and usefulness will be decided at the people who will you please remember all the work that you submit as your team assignments will definitely be released as a part of the we are repository of these evthe and therefore that will be available and accessible to lots of teachers add millions of students and that is the reason why we must actually try and do this team assignment were very very carefully and serious i also noticed that in two remote centers have come across teams which consists of only one person i can see why that might have happened i mean i put myself into the shoes of that person and i realized what i just mentioned some time ago i more comfortable working alone if i have three more parc tab and if all three turn out to be sleep buttons then i will end up doing all the would agree if those people are not sleeping partners but they do not contribute meaningfully they do shoddy work their documentation contains errors then i spread my time in correcting those hair is as the reasons why im tempted to work alone but the point is we want to actually nurture the notion of working together in te when i work in team even if i considered myself to be the best person in that team i must realize that because i am the best perhaps have a greater responsibility to take others together with me and please remember that in a theme park even if i am the best i will always learn something from every other team yes every human being every participant in any team has some very plus points which are so unique that theyre not available in us we can learn from every other human who works with us something or the other it not it is not necessarily the technical competence alone but is behavioral niceties the way of functioning meticulousness so many characteristic which individually we may not possess all of them but a team will contribute to them in the teams were in a manner where they are not physically at the same place it puts some additional problems in the path of the timber for example consider there is a team of four people all four of them actually work in different city or will they work together that is the reason why in the afternoon session today and this you may want to note down the major part of the second session i understand that some users reputation simon a half appear assessment must be completed the time has been extended till today evening so you might want to use the part of the first afternoon session to complete the if you already completed you can directly go towards the app now cut during of the teamwork which i will now explain so let us come back to the cage where four people have to do a team were over a period of time but they are all not coming to a common place as colleagues in the a collage or a student
