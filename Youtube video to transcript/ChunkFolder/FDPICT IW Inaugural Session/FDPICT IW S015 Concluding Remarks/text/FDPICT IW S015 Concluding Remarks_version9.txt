but the fourth person does not have the life the other four percent said boss if you do this i will not be able to contribute anything i can use only this open source app or the benefit of that one person all the remaining three must agree to use that software which is commonly used i am elaborating but is very important that initially itself the team decides what kind of pizza software will be used to prepare that project and what kind of communication standards will be a stab the second thing is about the discipline of the activity itself the activity itself thus they said could be a project of your choice that tab you may decide to do generally resulting in an ohio and as i already mentioned think about the possibilities that three or four of you are two of you whatever be the teams i can do together but let us be very clear about this the team effort is expected to be equivalent of what should i say two days of full time work that is what is the team effort one day a full time work is eight hours on end up two days a full time work sixteen hours let me see each individual member must put it on is to god sixteen hours of work since the coordination in team takes away some time this will be plus or minus some plans but not mind that this effort obviously cannot be put in a single day it has all of us have to do so many other things i would submit that the best way of going about it i to divide the work such that you can spend two hours every day he advantage will be that you will have to attend to emails which come from your colleagues tell me some consolidation and coordination of the work that will have to be done and therefore spread the work is a time frame which is suitable for all of the time limit that has been announced for submitting the team assignment is two weeks after the conclusion of the tidbits that is whenever the ten week online activity of the evthe ends you have to complete and submit the team assignment four weeks is the time because four days of work not two days of work but four days of work has to be done but the team to the total amount eifert is out thirty to hours of effort on each individual and thats a huge amount now you may not take four weeks you may compress it to two weeks were complicit to three week you may even compressing to one week if all the team members are sitting together and working at the same but suffice it to say that the material that you produce at the requires that you submit along with it i will explain what records will have to submit must demonstrate very clearly that every member of the team has put in the required amount rtfa please note that the wire that you produce not only should be usable not only should be high quality but it should be almost like a work of art that you should be proud of yes hundreds and thousands of people are going to look at tha your names are going to be written on that we are your names are going to remember and therefore it should be a matter of great pride that you perform that act of all very very careful and delicate coming back to the scheduling of the activity that i mentioned such a team has to be coordinated at there has to be one team leader multiple people cannot take decisions on the same time
