but good enough that all of us must be extremely careful in ensuring that intellectual property is respected and protect one of the reasons why we have embarked on this large scale effort on creating open educational resources is that all learners can freely utilised at they can do so perfectly legal now i come to the second part and the main part of my session which relates to the next two weeks of her online activities namely building and nurturing collaborative community all of us are very comfortable working alone when i work alone on a given task i see several advantages first of all i can do that work at any time and place that i choose i dont depend on others second i control the quality of that work so i dont have any meddling from others heard if there is a team of people then i have to live with the idiosyncrasies of those people in the tea and this is not only related to their different professional competencies but they were their work habits their behavior you know how difficult it is for multiple people to work together even personnel interaction would force a problem so these are some of the disadvantages because of which i would like to work alone however let us look at the advantages of any team working together a stable when i work alone the amount of time that i can spend is always limited approach there are only twenty four hours in a day if you stay three or four people work together each one can contribute substantial amounts and therefore the sum total of the efforts that a team can putin is always larger then the effort that any one person can in fact thats an oxymoron it is a mathematically proven fact that sum total of a number of peoples effort is always greater than the effort by one person but i might want to add greater than or equal to why we are all other members are sleeping member that is their only notional neighbors but they dont do any work then the contribution will be only same as my own choices to be understood in a show that the team actually count if in fact it contributes in such a meaningful fashion then as it is no many times two plus two does not become poor but it can become a team for four people were injured two people and their work in ordinated fashion in a collaborative way then the total work is quantitatively and qualitatively much better in what a single individual can this is not just to say that teamwork is important but i will also add one more thing if you look at problems that engineers and scientists of this century are expected to solve ugh all multi disciplinary problems as have already mentioned once these problems are both complex and multi disciplinary and therefore can not ever be solved by any single individual there are all to be solved by multiple teams working together at these teams must collaborate and coordinate their rep sadly we have not develop habits of working together efficient more sadly we have no important in our curriculum which will train our students to work together in teams in our i the system we invariably have group projects which are part of
