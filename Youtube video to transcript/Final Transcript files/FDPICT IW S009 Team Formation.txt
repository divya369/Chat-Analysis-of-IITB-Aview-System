the centrally in any collaboration there is always an element of voluntary nature of a human be but often such collaboration is prescribed by the need of the organization so staff of a section in office will collaborate also because not just because theyre volunteering to work together but also because they require to do a class of stools on the other hand may work together or may not work together there may be groups and subgroups form who we discuss a particular problem but when the teacher is enforcing a common synchronous events such as a discussion in the class then everybody is required to participate in a similarly if you take educational activity whenever there is a team assignment the team of members is supposed to work together and that is part prescriptive part volunteer for example we often ask our students to form teams now this part is voluntary so they decide which are the people were like minded or who can work together to form a team however once a team is form the teacher will say all right this team shall do this activity this is the kind of nature of the collaborative work that happens in any organized towards the end this evthe we are going to talk about building and nurturing collaborative community which is a much larger vision and much larger thing but as a precursor to that and of course as a requirement of this evthe we are saying that we start doing teamwork right from now so let us look at what is required to be done is for this hefty piece skills first and foremost all of you participating from a nazi are required to form teams a team to comprise two to four participants so they can be three participants but they should not be more than four participants and they should not be less than two participants and more importantly the teams must be of those participants which are participating from a given archive that weiss membership of the team across remote centers is not permitted as far as this hefty piece i would like in fact the first lab session today to be spent on a the team formation and be the work that has to be done by the team this work will be related to the boodle things that you have done there is a site called demo dot date on which each individual can practice i believe we had given this identity of the url to people and many people would a practice that the differences that would in todays lab session you have to work in teams so if there is a team of three people for example all three people should work together in the first session they should work together to do the prescribed assignment on paper in the second session they should use demo dot net and establish whatever is to be required to be done and do that as team let me explain the composition of tiny some more details plus towel each team has to have a team leader this will not be imposed by the hefty pure workshop coordinator but the two three or four people who come together have to choose a leader from amongst themselves ideally the team formation should be such that these team members should be able to meet at least occasionally or once in awhile physically together for brief meeting of course this is not compulsory thing that all people must belong the same city same institution if theyre from different cities are different and institutions they can collaborate only using asynchronous mechanism such as emails will prescribe the collaborative mechanisms in more details tomorrow when i meet you again the team to conclude is expected to interact in face to face meetings such as the occasion of this face to face interaction for example and they must also use other asynchronous mechanism they could be a shared server or emails etc what is most important is a team is collectively responsible for the activities that are done by all members the tee so team leader as the representative the team will be doing single submissions the first submission to be done by team leader is the membership of the team itself for example if i am chosen or elected as a team leader by a team of four people then the first thing i must inform the epc coordinates which is my workshop coordinator is that look i am so also these my email id and i have with me these see other colleagues were members so four of us form the team and i am the team leader now this prescription of in what format you should prescribe or you should give the information about your team will be put up on the web on the wood which you can look at when you go to the a site in the afternoon but what is most important is that the exercises that will have to be done by the team have to be done collaboratively i will have a lot more to speak on on the collaboration tomorrow so i have one more slide to show these teams which are form are not arbitrarily form these team shall work not only are the assignment or the lab work today there will also work for all such team assignments in the coming weeks of this every ppi including the final submission that is to me so please remember this team formation is an important activity and once you form a team that team remains the team for rest of the evthe including the philosophy obviously the activities that people will do will pertain to some domain as all of your aware in the first four weeks you already identified domains of work now these domains are the fields of education that we talk of how invested they listed further jingellic slide so these are the domains that have been written here please see that the domains numbered one two three four five six seven eight nine ten have already been listed earlier we added one more domain here which is code numbered zero which says educational technology why we have added this there maybe some teams which instead of working on a specific area of engineering or science or architecture or any such specific domain they might work they might wish to work generically on use of educational technology it could be related to pedagogy could be related to educational technology activity if they wish to do that then they should identify themselves as working for a domain code zero you may choose any domain for the activity today that need not necessarily remain your domain for the other team activities however we would prefer that you and your team sticks to a particular domain forest the work so that you can collaboratively work together to conclude in the first session in the lab session today ugh if you spend some time in deciding on the membership i must advise you on one possible problem i understand that some of our colleagues are not able to attend the session today many of them have indicated so by email however i presume that these participants were not able to attend are well known to at least several other participants in the a group that is working at a particular remote center i will therefore suggests that the team formation should include in even those people were today not present for some reason or the other if a particular person is absent of course that we will know from the attendance that is submitted by the workshop content but the team formation as far as possible should include these people in the exceptional case where nobody is familiar with a person who is missing such a person who is missing the session today or even tomorrow is required to interact with the workshop coordinator and get oneself abroad as part of one of the teams that team leaders therefore should be open to have one or two additions to their teams to this extent to retain the flexibility i would suggest that the initial team formation should not exceed three people wherever feasible of course i leave it to your own discussions that will happen in the first part of the lab session today so to recapitulate firstly you will form teams secondly you will identify the domain in which the teams are going to work now and subsequent the second part to the lab session requires you to work collectively on a link that has been given for the the woodlot debut in the first session you have to actually set up a quest that assignment is being uploaded so all of you can read that when you login for your lab session basically we want you to create a multiple choice quails in a particular domain that you have chosen for your team this work has to be done jointly please note setting up multiple choice questions to test the thinking and understanding of a student is not an easy job and that is why i want you to spend time working on paper and working collaboratively so if i am a member of the team of three persons for example and we have chosen the domain computer science or we have chosen the domain of electronics which is part of the electrical and allied fields then three of us will sit together and decide what should with a specific topic on which we should set this page then after choosing the topic we should do a paper design each one can contribute one or two questions and we should actually come up with a set of questions which will comprise the final quiz once we do this paperwork in the second lap session we have to work collectively we might be working on different machines if you want to but finally the team leader should ensure that all questions that you have decided that ways are put together on the demo dotnet thing and you just take one screenshot of the final quiz that screenshot will be uploaded only by the team lead one more submission that has to be done is that the team leader is required to submit to the workshop coordinator the members of the team giving certain details we shall be outlined the format will be outlined all of you are required to fill up in that format and the workshop coordinators are requested to upload
