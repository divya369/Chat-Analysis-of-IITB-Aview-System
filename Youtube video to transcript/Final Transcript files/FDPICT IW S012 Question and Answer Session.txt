the dub spoken materials youre most welcome to use them as well and our team will be there to help with that i would like to get started actually my question is no remaining like your content i have just concern energies not zeichen chamber there are so many participants in our artsy center excellence in this course we have this concern regarding like a peer assessment sir a continuously monitoring that people are not doing their jobs english in because of that where suffering who are making league hailey hardware for making your assigned managers for example our like backpage and everything an answer after putting all this thing and even a discussion forum will not getting any satisfactory answer from the irish staff and every time we just get answer is like that theyre in two ways your ascendant is bound to be considered a bit this is consistently happening for a all their ascendancy for views sold four assignments and then i think it is really very disappointing i do now i mean how did you because it is discouraging us to do make efforts for it and peer assessment is so far i mean what i a we have observed is that he is not successful in this case so kindly please take some kind of rika a steps toward that end please try to do something regarding this otherwise i mean a motivation for us its not like an unproper way naming so kindly address this issue okay i will answer it as follows although the repros shareasale accessworld my part all we are learning some of these methods you as well as us okay l there is quite a bit of learning involved not only as the world over everybody is in the learning process and given our limited time and effort that we can spend all this work we have literally for hours for example ive been answering all the questions in the discussion forum for vacay ay i sleep at twelve a clock i would get up once again early the morning to answer the questions locate the answers are to be meaningful correct i cannot give arbitrary answers it has to go to so many people so in view of that the limited time that we have we have to spend properly one of the things we are trying to do every instructor is trying to get a working answer we dont want to give just one answer somebody said that this person has not given proper assignment proper answer i can go and check every one of them but i would have sufficient time instead we should actually look at systemic solution how to prevent this maybe you just change one rule the whole thing will change so i would want you to instead of just talking about it is not being done properly i would want you to give suggestions change this rule at this rule remove this rule the okay and that will be lot more helpful we are looking in that direction we are looking at research papers that are coming out our it group is also working in this area doing research we have close to notify people godwin poetry so these are areas in any new area we can do two things one is to say we will do the peer assessment only later after we know the answer in this case many courses of this type cannot be offered how do we grade you there are four thousand of you we would have so many people to get so shall be posted how soon until we know the answer or do we get along we get started find answers to whatever we know right now give grades to the best extent possible using the knowledge that we already have so these are the two options when we went for nationwide thousand teacher training program that was a photo a day that was a great jump because we were doing cpe courses for only thirty people at a time so we decided to go for a thousand people that is equal to thirty courses in some sense a tty years light should we have stopped because some methods are not known should have waited for the perfection of the method as a matter of fact i would say that unless you run them euro really understand some of the issues so we have no option but to get on with whatever we have using whatever knowledge we have using whatever imperfections we have thats the only way we can make progress okay i hope i have answered it i dont want to answer this any further because there are other people who are working in this area like prose a fatter professor murthy and soon they will come up with answers i do not want to answer any more questions on peer assessment in this session patty i answered it to the extent i can okay i would suggest that you talk to other people if you have further questions on this please talk to the tricky bella institute please go ahead book your kindly clarify what is difference between a spoken tutorial and screencasts yeah good question let me repeat the question what is the difference between a screencast and sparql tutorial a spoken tutorial a has been created using screencasts methodology screencast is a method just like you have video recording your screencast what is screen cuz it records a scree okay now if you give a running commentary along with that then you have the audio also it is possible to have screencast without audio at all as a matter of fact in the year two thousand seven when our methods started the spoken tutorial a was created first time there were many tutorials without an audio explanation the regis videos and so we thought that let us give audio in all our creations so we did screencast we added our voice because you dont see our face we called it spoken tutorial right whereas you see my face now whereas in the spoken tutorial ified in all spoken tutorials you dont see anybodys face we called it spoken tutorial we also decided to dub them into all tweedy to languages for the benefit of our children who may be weak in english okay we have lots of children who are very smart but not necessarily fluent in english so we said that let us offer our tutorials into their languages also how do you i do this by dubbing only the spoken part lucky of course one can ask what about the screen you have everything in english we said let it be in english because our children want jobs in indian industry and to get a job and knowledge of english is very useful let them use normal computers let them not demand devnagari keyboard because how many people with devon agree keyboard experience will get jobs in it industry how many of them will get job in this years infosys wipro and so on the cadet use normal computers they would use normal keyboard normal screen so we said we will dub only the spoken part everything else will be in english because we dub the spoken part once again into alternative languages the spoken word is extremely important to us so we called it spoken tutorial light spoken tutorials or have three important things that an ordinary screen cause may not have what is it first of all spoken tutorials are created for self learning we go through so much effort you seen the processes involved in creating spoken tutorial so they put in so much effort that it is suitable for self learning no other screencast created tutorial claims this but we claim it that is one major difference second difference we dump them into all twenty to indian languages nobody else can claim that ours is the largest collection of ici and software and whatever you see on the computer available as instructional material in indian languages we have about five thousand six hundred tutorials we have hundred and twenty in sanskrit we have very large number of reasonable in nepali closed to foreign debt in all our twenty two languages so how many other projects can claim this is the second one the third one which is equally important is that if you go through youtube you see lots of videos but then it is very difficult for you to download them and not saying that you cannot but ordinary people like me cannot download of course there are experts a deity who always say i know how to download but then i have to go through extra effort to download on the other hand understanding the difficulty of our students in getting bandwidth most of our children dont have access to bandwidth just imagine in a lab potty people learning literacy tutorials and everybody is downloading directly from the internet directly stream what will happen to bandwidth infact i would claim that even in haiti which has quite a good band with our system will collapse forty people downloading streaming in parallel videos ride itll happen in every college okay where as a result youtube based videos which are also created using screen cars or not suitable for instructional purposes of course the other problem is in youtube you have them in a haphazard manner whereas we say here is the specific sequence win even number the one two three and we go to any one we say look this is the prerequisite and we say open this video we want you to use the side by side method sidebyside method means supposing the video i open as a file you should also be able to open otherwise how can you practice side by side i am telling that every command demonstrated in the video should be done by you to be reproduced by you so i wont this plot file the needed data file type open the read a file i dont give the data file to you how do you open it so how is it possible they say in youtube videos so here we said that it must be available in fact i showed a video called side by side method i strongly encourage you to see that it tells you about the pedagogy involved that pedagogy we have you taken arbitrary screencast created video it may not be available so these are all the differences between spoken tutorial an ordinary screencast so screencast is a methodology anybody can created i would say that our project is quite different we do use screencasts ride every spoken tutorial is created using screencasts but every screen cars cannot be a spoken today just answered your question yes sir and welcome good morning i mentioned remedy aurangabad have one question we are doing a lot of activities through necessity a blended learning he had a house he even area having more than returns and people were registered in this domain we are working from the past two months and so what is my question is how we can focus in research oriented activity schedule be very helpful for individuals because most other people theyre doing their research if editior farming some guru based upon these activities on the domain net even at the same time i rebounder is helping some kind of business youre in an activity for them it will be the more helpful permit how you can support participation in research oriented activities through this i hit a blended learning thats a good question the question is most of the participants who are in this course or interested in research whether this activity can help in their research whether they can participate in the research that say ohio research books research and soul at this question is from marathwada institute of technology i am happy to receive this question as i mentioned earlier a ighty bombay has an education technology a program wherein we offer only prehistory degrees a we are of course there is a lot of demand to to join the space the program from a prospective faculty members a prospective students who are currently faculty members of our a we have slowed down on peachtree admissions mainly because we dont have too many faculty members in the education technology we are only one full time faculty member that is process alamoudi now precise sridhara yous join arm has been deputed by computer science to go into education technology and we are looking for both faculty members to join this program and i would like to point out we dont get enough good candidates who can become faculty members at iba because we have some norms and so on some requirements and so we are looking for outstanding candidates who can joy as faculty members so this can happen only if all of you the whole country does lot more search this area if lot of people do research then some research will be outstanding and some researchers will be outstanding and we would have more people together choose from that lot as our faculty members who can of course promote this activity even more vigorously who can admit many more people as prehistory candidates so in view of that its an excellent question so i would say the term urban thing is to look at our education technology research there are people whose names are listed here i would say that i would urge you to go to the e a webpage and look at the a the profiles of faculty members who are listed there look at some of their papers go through the papers for example i shared one paper with you on solomons arm effectiveness study with a low cost affordable laptop okay so you can actually see how a study is conducted what kind of in life you would write a paper then there is a reason for doing that study which is typically explained introduction background work then you have research questions what are the questions we want to address and how do we go about conducting the study how does one ask questions how does will prepare a questionnaire so that it is acceptable offer example in the paper that i shared with you there are two tables there is one table called likes another table called dislikes but i didnt ask them separately these are the reasons you like this computer tick tick tick tick these are the likely reason why you dislike the computer tick tick tick i didnt do that because the problem is what is the guarantee that they actually read the question and answer what do they say strongly disagree tick tick tick strongly agree tactic without even reading that kind of answer is not accept the you need a mechanism to find out whether the answer is reliable whether people who are answering the questionnaire or giving consistent answers so how do we do that we mix the two so for example because of this reason i like it agree strongly agree disagree whatever semantics one essay because of this reason i hate this computer so these are mixed so if somebody says ticks everywhere the neuro that that person is in the not serious through the vagina and survey so these are some methods that you must follow to make sure that the questioner itself is consistent okay so he can see in every step of that work there are issues i needed to address them okay if you want to work in this area research methodology is a course that is offered if im not mistaken i te bombay has already made it available we have already offered through yakima bags i would suggest that you go through this um if you want to participate in i feel kind of work if you want to do in they say we are creation and validation that it is good not good i told you about creation spoken tutorials creation of a textbook companions live migration okay i would want you to become passionate about for example open source software because it allows you to a player on with it it allows you to open it it allows you to update it allows you to whereas if it is proprietary everything happen it would not do anything you click it uses apple users use it its like saying its a car you have right but you cant open the hood if you want to be a mechanic you should be able to open the hood and go through it take it out put it back and things like that so if you want to say i want to get into this area i want to do oh yeah i want to create content i want to work with open source software then you must have access to software you must be able to put things together you must be able to modify things to a so that it meets your requirement so there are many things that you need to do i would strongly encourage you to do open source software i dont know whether i have answered your question but please engage with us please find out what our people are doing try to read and then if your specific question in our supposing you say you ask a faculty member and say look i went through this paper i have this specific question can you please answer somebody will answer but supposing you say oh i dont know what education technologies can you please help me nobody will answer right because you have to show interest you have to take initiative please take initiative somebody will answer i hope i have answered your question thank you arguments are myself a satyr pradeep lakshmi from mark willingham university we are representing the remote center college of engineering i already raised a question in the forum about the way to use the we are that its open educational repository and basically from a serious background so i see that a pharisee programming book you have created the examples everything using the si lap so with the help of the cylab coding how can you teach the see coding and how much this will be usefull to the students of computer science department arm that is a good question a doctor people exwe from colossi lingham university and who is attending madurai thiagarajar college its a very nice question how does one use we are in general and how to use the skylab the textbook companion or whatever it is for programming i would at the outset point out that a forci programming or whatever you want to achieve in a programming course cylab is not necessarily the best programming environment mainly because it is created for numerical computation so let us see why sylar was created it was created by a person by name a professor clive bowler when he was a faculty member in new mexico state university in the us he wrote it for the first time in fortran in late seventies okay as a matter of fact when i was a fiercely student are in the in eighty eddie one i downloaded brothers are available this photon code was available i downloaded compiled and ran on pcp lt pieces just come i random on peace eighty they worked perfectly but professor clive bowler used to ask when i am teaching matresses in my class i write a equals be and everybody understands why is it the computer doesnt understand why is it i have to tell the computer that is of dole procession the ditched her so much space okay and i have to do raw times column why should i explain all this is it not possible for me to come up with an environment that will handle all this automatically so he wrote this it he it was created with a government funds and so it was made available for everybody we of course so it was mainly created for matrix multiplication matrix manipulation in fact it has been optimized for vector arithmetic okay so if you have lot of competition for example if you want to do numerical analysis humidities linear algebra cigarrette chords its very popular in most engineering departments electrical engineering image processing a chemical engineering control purposes and own it is highly apt whereas for programming per say i would say python is a very good programming environment so i would say is it possible to re do the entire file up textbook companion you soar into python tucker another outstanding a language is julia jay you a lie a julia is a great programming language you can now read about it now did you ask this question let me give also a slightly different answer this may also answer the previous question for example somebody arse look this video is already available how do i used in my class there is a zero you you have come across i am sure that your been taught this flip method i think in the early part of this course somebody taught you afflict method a i have used the flip method for many years now i think it is the sixer ive actually done it seven times seven years five times for my postgraduate control course digital control and i followed the same method twice to my undergraduates first time i did for sixty students second time i did this flip method for herndon a thirty students in which i used my own video recorded courses study material integral control i created videos i left them similarly my other course which is process control undergraduate level first control course also i created several lectures and gave it to them and i told the students you must read and come to the class okay of course there is a question of students doing more work if you ask them again i have three hours of lecture i have created i let them you read the three lectures and come to the class also for three hours the students complain d one way to do three plus free six hours whereas in other classes i would spend only three hours in your course are to spend six hours this unfair i do want to do it so as a result we optimized the method but i can do is i can share that a paper i infact i would say it is a successful paper successful research study which appeared a cern as a paper on atripla international conference i would share that with you because unless you take care of this particular a perception of students namely they dont have to do much more work than other courses for example there was in fact a study conducted if i am not mistaken at texas aandm university for nursing students nursing students they did a flipped method and i and of course at the end of the cold they found that everybody had done well does performance was not better than other courses then they also ask questions do you like the scores most of them said they yet at the course most of them said they hated the course because it was too much work in the us it might work because they pay thru the nose to study in india our students will stop coming to class they come to class they will do something else when they say anyway your asking us to do too much work so this flip method will not work if there is cooperation from students you need to come up with proper management techniques as well for this method to succeed so i have the paper ive shared with you so this flip method is available to all of you you take any topic a codes is available in pistol i assume that a of course its available mostly for engineering there are signs a methods also but then i gave you some more links in the discussion pages i gave you links of a key part salem it was created by ubc i also gave links to web pages created by see if it is not available if your topic is not available but it is available in lets say we see the w they say if it is available in stanford for everyone it is available in open air you are welcome to use them you can always say that for this topic gondry unadorned teach but i could conduct a test ride nobody can prevent you from doing it right you conduct the class youre awesome and you say the based on the downward you fireworks all autonomous colleges can do that all autonomous universities can do that please go with a proposal to your vice chancellor and say that look i have done this i believe this will work the students will actually like it they will do better loki as a matter of fact i would like to inform you about a quiz app that one of my colleagues here a professor a busker to boston and professor chemistry there are two faculty members in computer science at idi bombay theyve come up with a an app called i think its safe quiz or something like that what he does is you have a multiple choice question you have multiple choice questions students can answer them through their mobile basically the software takes control of the mobile and they can only do ansari okay the students like it of course there are some people who do it with a paper in my flip class method what i used to do was your to go through three hours of video but i would meet only once in a week youd go through this three hours come to the class once a week but i would conduct a quiz and i would give you marks okay i these marks will count towards your overall grade okay i know there were ten questions every week ten questions in fact i had done this ten times ten times weekly quiz twenty minutes insecure and many of them use this safe quiz app created by to sebastian and commissary pocket if i can share that quiz app with you in case you want to use it in your class so you can innovate the way you teach in fact this can be very close all of you teach what can happen is if i keep telling there are some people who are outstanding teachers cor bon teachers but they are very few listen one percent okay but if you use these methods even an ordinary teacher can provide outstanding teaching may not be we as good as bone teachers that some people were there only one person but looked the other ninety nine percent we can also teach well i am not a great teacher but if i have done lot of work what these icity base methods do is they allow you to do lot of prior work you write slides so i dont make mistakes right sunrise your pronunciation is not okay dont matter you keep saying it and then your video cameraman cut off all the wrong pronunciation you produce a good video lecture so these methods allow you to become good teachers if not outstanding teachers even an ordinary person can become a good teacher good enough for all practical purposes and these features can deliver good courses anywhere in the world in any university in the world light ill train you so these methods allow you to get better only thing required is are you willing to do the work if your willing to do the work if your willing to do research you are willing to do research that meets your willing to do the work if your willing to do the work then its fine if everybody can become a good teacher so there are lots of things he can do everyone i suggest do a flip method everybody at least for one class that i would suggest as a beginning first steps baby steps for doing research in this area i would share my clipplus method i would encourage you to go through it and if you have a specific question on that paper ill be happy to answer remember to put them in week eight disgusts thank you people expect you have but question quietly about a fuzzy laptop now it is available for rattan thousand rupee suppose if i want to purchase it whom should i contact in ady is it possible for a bulk purchase and is their guarantee period for that a good question i have this laptop a infant baby i had the given a link a tiny you are all in one of the discussions aware i have asked you to give details inside ive asked you questions like when do you think that your people be interested how many people do you think will be interested if there is some question i misheard you can write in this text box yes it comes with warranty it is a rupees ten thousand including first years services are in a place like madurai im pretty sure that services available in all major cities are pretty sure services can be made available if a large number of computers are bought in an institute then it becomes easy to provide services okay so supposing this to three hundred computers are sold then there is enough money kept aside for servicing somebody can even be in a paid salary out of that mud okay so im not saying that to three hundred should be sold in that collage even neighbors can buy it right your run secretaries can buy your bus drivers can bite although they have to do is the numbers are sold and theyve contributed to that if there is a problem they can bring it to that centre it could be bought by your neighboring school which says i want to give this computer to all my teachers i am unable to give it to all my students but can you give it to my teachers they can be done so it is available right now and the as a matter of fact you know if if a college earn a if we know that a college is thinking about purchasing a large number of computers will be more than happy to provide further assistance there are specific questions ill be happy to answered and thank you so much for the information you have were provided sir infact regarding the flipped classroom i myself and my friend are darker ramlet me we have adopted this concept for rattan topics in the course object oriented programming in sleeplessness and thank you so much to ady bombay for this wonderful effort sir thank you that your personal cup a sizeable rumer composer huge department or college name or group of nutrition remote and for one one six one day i have not attempted took with a surge in high def bombay exporter because of confusion between a model and aty bombay two portals other oh can you kindly put a quicker and assignment in one portal but is oh so the question is from another group of institutions from authority because of two different portals where you missed two quiz can both be put in was the why gut feeling is i roy dont deal with this guy just a person who delivers the scores but my gut feeling is that it cant be done it cant be done for various reasons we need to have both a home so this is already raised and we have agreed that maybe we can keep the same deadline for both so you should remember to put them thats what i believe somebody would answer if they can merge the two will be more than happy of course youll also be equally happy but i dont know the answer to this question but there can be replaced by just one that i dont know but theres some pretty sure can be kept he said that a feedback will go to the organizers for one thing whatever previously we attended the workshop we have used only muddle turban better tie dyed so the question is we use only model when we had our teton kitty a this is in the way we are doing okay but the whole world seems to be going towards books okay and as a result a books beans there is a tangible content created all the discussions properly recorded and the short clips put discussions for them assignments for them so in that sense this books seems to be a different way of packaging the same thing a for apparently a better efficacy i mean people can study at any time verstraeten kit is something that you are to be there at the time okay and it also requires a lot of bandwidth a it also requires lot of machinery for one thing titan katie means people want a ride whereas in books we dont have to give it a i am not complaining but then the taxpayers are complaining the ministry is complaining when books can be run without any expenditure why id bobbys demanding so much money for a tea a day or two as a matter of fact our teeth and kitty project more than half the money was earmarked for the idiot eros notify crowd so the government says maddy fakelore is lot of money that is of course for fifteen courses to train a one lakh fifty thousand teachers through tytn kitty so the government says that that money can be used for several other important things let us do it just buy books because itll cost anything and not only that lot of people we are doing research on improving moocs the learning will be better it can be translated to other languages it can be shared with overseas countries it can be offered again and again so there are many advantages in in moves that we should go towards books so we have a uti barbeques of course we strongly believe that we should continue with our live interaction also that is why even though we dont have it fully for this course we do offer it and if it is because of the titan kitty we are able to talk to each other in person although at a distance ride we can see each other you can see what a short time varying i can see how many people are sitting in your classroom and a many people are sitting in the front row amelia in the back row armani ladies are their armani ladies are asking question so on and so far we are able to find all this and of course you also get to see whether we start the thing in time and whether our mike is okay a lot of lot of nice things out we field the questions and how do you ask a question so they are there is a lot of learning that happens in a in a synchronous interaction what we are doing here is synchronous interaction i supposed to let idiva makes books which are mostly a synchronous titan katie was completely synchronous but it is very expensive so we are going towards art mostly a synchronous through books but we have little bit of synchronous that allows us to see each other at least once in awhile okay so a because of these reasons we need to have too because high tiber makes has its own way to assess do projects or whatever other moodle has its own moodle was used a tytn kitty until all the features become available in edible eggs i assume that you have to do both i hope i have answered your question the money minimise suzukis from artsy anyone to senate as deum institute of technology virginia i have a question and we are actually a lot of resources are available in a womans apartment a how to guarantee or who will guarantee the quality of deserve educational resources so good question this question is about who will guarantee the quality of the courses available through a voice so i will give an extreme example a yoda heard of wikipedia wikipedia has millions of pages all created by contributors okay now it is proven if i did it it got rude about fanad mistaken about three to four years ago that any mistake that comes into wikipedia gets corrected within nine minutes any mistake any mistake in any one of the million pages millions of pages gets corrected within nine minutes why because they are so many people were also check your going through because they are so many people using it every page gets used every page gets corrected every page gets commented upon and so on so that is a example that we should always keep in mind that should be the method that we should go for and if a lot of people use it comment on it corrected voyeur will become better occurs we are off a from that ideal because wikipedia is an exception its an unusual the ten unusually good we are thats a reason on any topic if you say you do a search whatever be the search engine whether it is google validities microsoft whether it is yahoo you will see wikipedia entry on the first page no matter what application writers reached that level up and as a matter of fact no other encyclopedia can come anywhere close to this open source software wikipedia so this should be the ideal this be the goal for all the way your projects so in the meantime so what do we do we have to be careful but be careful about the veracity correctness of the material taught in that and of course if you take it from reputed people hopefully itll be good but even then take it with a lil bit of a pinch of salt that they could be something wrong if you are told unfortunately in some states there are no entrance exams for higher studies and it is based only on state boat parts and the students are in or told to study just from the book reproduce the book in your exam you will get two handed on to and you will get admission in medical colleges united admission engineering colleges in fact in some states children unfortunately dont even study the eleventh grade portion eleventh grade students come within one month eleventh grade is finished and they study the twelfth grade book for two years why they want their children to get toned down to unded so once they got the class got the engineering college your many people fail many people fail because in engineering college and professional colleges that method no longer works okay so these children are told to study from the book not to ask questions the faculty members also say no no dont ask questions he must mug you must be able to reproduce everything in the book now if he take that attitude obviously we are is not going to work you should ask his correct ill verify not only should we ask this question we should also ask our children why cant we say that doesnt matter you dont get admission doesnt matter but i want you to understand the topic i want it is the eleventh standard portion i want you to study that we cant be said so the answer to your question is why are topics could have some mistakes you should ask questions go to reputed people then such occurrences of mistakes could be less although not necessarily there is no guarantee that no mistake at all okay i hope ive answered your question a year and that means we need to be very careful even in na what information is right what information is wrong we need to verify it on the time and probably it will be taking little more time in our efforts yes i think it is worth it even from a book even in the book standard book there is a theorem proof youd understand the proof and ask are all the steps in the prove correct ride if you think that some sap is wrong then you know hey ino this fellow you hired will carefully this book amtrak would standard textbooks of course we have many local textbooks floating around which we created through copy paste of course your paycheck you to check the correctness so obviously if you go for top of the line book then you know it is a great book light whereas a book has been created in your own college brown university so that your students will get mods you be careful check it right a kitten i have one question regarding oh thats okay so a good question guess the question is if answers are also given so does just copy them and answer them and theyre not done what we do so its a trade off that we should give a little bit so that they do get confidence i its like saying that we have to give model answers i follow two methods are just excellent you i dont know whether it is implementable in the universe this system but i always do that on one thing is if you look at our textbook companions with sex i lept textbook companion we have filed thirtyfive books available right now these have code for only solve problems we have not given code for any unsolved problem so we ask the students you please do that and verify whether edwards that is one thing the other thing that i always ask in all my exams how do i find out i always try to find out whether a student has understood the subject how do we find that out i have one method i always ask some questions for about twenty to thirty percent of the portion on topics that i have not taught in the class outside the portion i ask twenty to thirty person questions if people have understood everything that i have taught then understood then they can extend that knowledge to solve new problems whereas the new problem it is on a topic that i have not taught docket and of course i show them the steps do this what do you find then do these calculations you can show that this is equal to this and so on and so forth it is all given in a more or less a learning board and only students who have understood the previous ones can do this so in other words it is at least for me it is very easy to set questions that help me find out whether the students have understood it is a matter of their coffee does matter but at least for this thirty percent i can find out the only students whove understood can get this answer correct and those students who have mucked up the book for two years in order to get wanted on two android instead board exams cannot they will get zero in this that okay so i can release it reagan also released but awesome extra questions next year you release the new question answer old questions and yours one more question you can go on coming up with new questions every year there are infinite number of you questions to ask the giants smith from earlier institute of technology in research continued my question is related to the textbook companion project i am from a background of electronics inc communications have gone through textbooks the standard text book projects they have done okay so ive gone through the sign up code also and we are using at our universities i left so i tested a few of the courts so most of them are working thats not but i found that it can be made much simpler also show that student can take it but sylar in our university was founded our students are very afraid of the cylab earlier the truck they know about matlab thats why but later on then they got into this first semester itself we started to make them to your silly but still they are afraid of it so i think that some textbook company project scilab code it simpler so i would like to contribute towards thieves to further what i have to do i just want guidance from you as well as the second part that how to make our students feel that scilab theyre very much afraid of select comfort at lab we have a license copy of matlab at our university but we want to promote scilab and few of our faculty have done lab migration project also in here in the field of a probability theory and random process image processing applied mathematics so hed want to promote it but our university students are very afraid of select seo how to remove that thats my question okay so they were actually many questions volleys so this is from a lady or pay college of engineering in gujarat for there were many questions ill name some of them one is students are afraid of sylar how to remove the fear that is number one number two how to contribute to scilab textbook companion and possibly a third question how to contribute to live migration for second and third i will answer first it is given in our web page i showed some webpages if you go and see select textbook companion a opening page at the bottom it says there are instructions orders work attribute this go and see that all the information is given the okay if you still have questions you please put it as a question in this discussion forum for this week and a if there are specific questions ill be able to answer but all the information is available both for textbook companion and live migration it also tells different steps in that it also tells the auditorium available all kinds of things in all gory details are provided they can do this for textbook companion and also lab migration a one of the important things is if you want to remove the fear for the ball i dont see any reason why they should be a fear to use a sailor i in fact if you ask me to use matlab i be scared because i dont know the commands will ive not been using matlab for separate years tide whereas cylab is what i use every day i saw i am very comfortable so the reason why they are comfortable they are not comfortable in mylar why theyre scared is that they use but like most of the time and only in one course they have to use they get scared so what i did at the beginning i said that look i dont have access to official copy of matlab my tea is also dont have access to official copy of metal as a result if you submit any assignment in matlab we cannot get it how do i graduate i need to have a copy of battle i dont have one how can a graded so you sign up i can credit so immediate compulsory students use to comply your being a dictator i can always say i could have immediately said show me so that you use official copy of matlab to create this assignment then i will determine whether i should grade or not i could have said that because how many people how many students use official copy of metal thats the first question that every one of you should ask is it the right thing should they be using inno illegal means that the first question that we should ask do they have matlab in their home you may have official copy in the college how many copies out there how many students as they can all the people used simultaneously these are some questions you can ask okay the second thing is i would say more important i would ask is can our industry afford matlack dino the cost of metlife to industry sexually expensive many times in fact he would even believe how expensive it is right so we are creating our engineers on matlab who cannot go and use it outside right its a serious problem its like saying i am teaching my students using a book which they cannot take outside my college compound because matlab is very expensive similarly for your baby cadence software very expensive once again maybe fluent or fluid mechanics once again very expensive you go naming excessively expensive software packages why are we trading our children on that whereas i can load sign up on this vision this can thousand rupee machine preloaded it comes preloaded with open form it comes preloaded with ism it comes preloaded with sage python and so on we can make this available this they can use legally anywhere whether theyre traveling whether they are at home or whether they go to even a small company that cannot afford an expensive software why are we teaching our children on things that they cannot use in industry are you being responsible to the industry are we being responsible to small and medium scale enterprises by teaching in matlab some of these companies if they use illegal software they have to go to jail there companies will twist out by using expensive software in academia we are being irresponsible toward society we are not doing the right thing coming but your first question how do we improve the fear you tell them use filler from novel no matlock therell be a fear for two days three days from next week onwards you see that theyre uncomfortable i have fifty interes at i adore bombay there all from different parts of the country they are all working on scilab bachand there improving silo toolboxes they improve excus appearance they are using mylar for remote triggered lives there putting ex cause on the cloud you come and tell them they are you scared they will laugh at you okay so the fear comes only because of lack of use please use i want all of you to say from today i will start using scilab i will ask my students to you select i will accept matlab only if i know so that they have used official copy of metal you take a word like this you will see that in one week there will be no fears fears will be completely gone okay thank you have a question regarding lotto what is the definition of bulk according to you purchase of our troubles of the question is what is meant by bulk purchase i dont have a correct definition of it i believe it is a few hundred to three hundred is probably a bulk purchase a basically uses out to the calculation assuming that plus a ten percent of the money is going to be kept for that same year support okay lets look at the second year onwards they say ten percent of the money we paid so that means thousand rupees per unit okay how much of such money is to be collected so that somebody can be place their salary can be paid for and then you can also bring in spare components for example your keyboard breaks your gyno there is a crack somewhere your yes be doosan were i not saying that it could happen but in any electronic device such a thing can happen and you may be an unfortunate person so it may happen in your machine while in knitting and other machines such a thing may not happen so its like an insurance that we are trying to build the notice of this whole thing works so you have to be realistic if a person must be kept one room must be given by your college and this person is available a salary can be paid or if theyre in a lot of people may be two people so that it is that service is available from early morning to late night so there are various amenities easy thing to calculate a jew i dont know the answer what is meant by bulk i would say a few hundred units due to your students may be interested we are located we have some idea about computation of nato also the question is about the configuration it has a two gibby rhyme teddy to gibby nand flash so that is equivalent of a disc a by the way i have this remark here this also has nine flash only thing is it has a lot more it might have heard and to initiate a gibby are tough this is jimmy but in the price of that is sixty thousandth or seventy thousand blood were expensive as a matter of fact you may be surprised in case any of you are thinking about buying a mac youll be surprised to know if i was shocked to know that if the keyboard breaks then you would replace the whole thing that cost about seventeen thousand rupees one seven thousandth just to change the keyboard so i said you know its crazy why should i do that i can buy this new laptop a ten thousandth time pay seventeen thousand to replace this crazy thing so this is an expensive proposition right as a matter of fact i am switching to this low cost laptop when i want to move away from this macbook air the main reason why i used to stay with the error i have been using mac os it used to create nice videos guy i create smuggled torials whether my tee shirt youre wearing this purgatorial tee shirt thats very important to me i got give demonstration people ask how do you create a tutorial i record until i give it but then as i demonstrated in one of the voyeurs i created a spoken tutorial using this on a lead take report writing and it is no inferior to this machine all that i had to do was to buy a firewall one rupee mirek and fitted into this its an extra fitting that i need but then i am not grading smuggled to realize all the time i have the mike ten other people can use it okay so if i have your two makes the whole department can use it its not drive your great expense but it empowers this machine so teddy to gibby nand flash is what it has a nowadays of course get thee to gibby a is the card that works with mobile phone for find dupes so your theory to jimmy becomes sixty possible of course people could say especially your students who download movies will say well he was a stripper jib is not good enough i would tell them even one terabyte is not enough for them because they can download lots of movies they need lots of terrabytes i in you keep it as external okay but i believe that if you just want to do a good academic world the tito jib is good enough utmost unit sixty punjabi is the spend another find rupees you have a great machine then you have learn point six inch screen you have to use be drives one mini istm iport a of course it has audio port input output it has a ten thousand image battery the battery lasts a long time it has a grid graphics engine i demonstrated the deacon etc you can create three d plots in silo very easily and simultaneously work with blender vagina do animation it was very fast and so on we can load it with almost any software its a complete linux machine if you have a specific question on any of the specifications please let me know i will answer that can there be a deal monschau too how to use island for the newcomers the question is is a detail workshop to your cupboards of cylab the answer is yes it is in the form of spoken tutorials spoken tutorials are created for self learning they are arranged in a particular sequence and while learning that people do active learning because in spoken tutorial they have to reproduce every command they just dont come and listen and go to sleep they have to reproduce every command so if they reproduce every command in twenty five spoken tutorials that is good enough to start with in addition you have five hundred and thirty five textbook companions in addition you have quite a few live migrations so if people do all this the next thing i would recommend this to a textbook company take a standard textbook code all the solve problems using site okay so in case you have difficulty look at the textbook companion in similar books so for example we have a question on how do i do phosphate also remember i did a search you do a search a fifty it gives you some twenty books that you safety in that go through and find out a book in your area open that book opened their example it tells you how to call fatigue the you know how to call a fifty per your example so just do that so textbook company in creation is the easiest for a person who has gone through these spoken tutorial ukip then after that the next question is can i do love migration okay we are happy to help you you yourself can say these are the ten problems in my life and i went through your live migration solution hey seven problems are already answered so now i have to migrate only three laps only three free problem free life sessions out of that i know how to do one i need help on two more will you please help i will say yes i tell my staff members so there is a great college out of ten labs they have themselves converted aid please do this immediately ill instruct argue in order to buy stuff to attend to you and to help you immediately so this is the way things progress by doing this what happens is you demonstrate your keenness in working with filler on the other hand if you say contact workshop we used to do that some people used in wet we are a great collage so many people are interested hundred people are good cum please cum our people and there is nobody nobody cannot find anybody you could go to the lab ten people and we will come slowly commandeer not interested we can do this there are thirty five thousand colleges in india there are five thousand engineering colleges in india like many of them want to do silo and they want to invite us not possible for us to go to all the colleges but if we know that a college is making sincere progress making a sincere attempt through the method that i describe then we go out of our way to help the college to handhold in fact we make them also our partners i go by heavens audioquest thank you so much in one oven instead of technology karnataka my questioning i conduct mill a law and after online student will be huge but i question what is a weighty one part of that cake in the acme of flip move good question this is from kelly institute of technology from hubli what is the value of these certificates so there are two ways to conduct these online tests one is the way thats available for exams like gate jay and several competitive exams where you will go to a center something like this years or some other centre and you pay lot a money order which about thousand to thousand find rupees will go from every student to the center to this company so if they do in such tests then there will be poorer by something like fifty thousand rupees because the cause of ethos and refuse to do that for this is one way to do that the other way is to say what we are we doing in purgatorial singer is free to debate i havent any money from you locate our project is funded by the government and irony to raise any money from you and our objective is to share the knowledge with you which we are ready to do without charging even a single paisa from you okay obviously there is no money to give to the online proctoring place rocket then given the scenario shall we talk about the second one plus one is quite clear if every student is willing to pay five thousand rupees for a test and they do ten such tests in a year fifty thousand rupees a year if all your students want to do that we can go for it i am assuming that they dont want to do it i am assuming that many students in the country cannot afford it so we are to go for the second one okay so what do we do in our certificate we put a line saying that this such and such person appeared in such and such a online tests it was administered by itee bombay it was protected by such and such words and found from southern such college so and so on and especially schoolchildren for example so what is this project look at this planetarium yodo go to a planetarium show is typically about forty five minute show where you go into these and there is a big dome and they turned the lights off and then you see the whole sky rocket and then you have a somebody who comes and explains here is the consolation here is the star and so on and so forth they talk about it but it is available to a very few people so we thought why dont we build open planetarium using real sky ride using real sky so what is it so the idea is that this there is this software called stellarium ride this stellarium is open source software it knows all about the sky it knows the entire configuration it has billions of stars and so on and so forth right now this stellarium knows ino supposing it is calibrated so you are in this particular city you are in this country are you on the northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere whatever it is the moment you do a calibration salieri knows exactly then in an in home in the planetarium show that i talked about there is of a divine minute script somebody says lets go here and sold similar script can be created in installation right then ill say go to let see the star at this point at this point means what you have to look at it at a particular angle from wherever you are so we have a laser pointer and that is connected to a stepper motor and this software gives instruction now change this and then you see the light of course it will happen only in a dark sky a so ill not be seen in a cloudy sky but in a dark sky which is their most of the time and in all small places it may not be sky is not visible in a big city like mumbai chennai buddy hugo fifty kilometres away sky is dark and you can actually see the star and then the us has fucked itorial comes on he tells the story in marathi stools tells a story in tamil hindi malayalam a nepali cassie bordeaux and solvents urdu sanskrit whatever language you choose and then you have the thing and then after that thing is done it moves on the script moves on raids of fortify minute script so this whole thing basically we have to come up with a circuit board a stepper motor laser pointer it has to interface with stellarium and the whole thing must be housed at the juneau be outputted in a closed container and the whole thing can be sold possibly for about a thousand rupees okay and that will work with our low cost laptop so every school can afford one every school can afford one any interested school can say hey tonight we are going to do a planetarium okay so people go with her daddy with a blanket and they all lie down in a maidan the their children come with her parents when they could sleep there listen to it and then go enjoy your drink tea or juice whatever is available a drinker but the water i end this whole thing happens just imagine for free every school this imagine what this will do to scientific curiosity just imagine we say that yellow isro is launching this ride our satellite is doing this our forefathers found out that mars will be ready
