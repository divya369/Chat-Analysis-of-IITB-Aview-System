we have directv and we had a really good as well who tech is here yeah one breathtaking has come of it reject ike cookies in his presentation is awesome what is a view and probably didnt impact at an immature vera generic program what it is if you water them okay so of what is our work our current ebay version five okay so a thank you th as per university for the feedback so what i would also request you to all the teachers is to send a small report to outreach on which all are seas actually presented and what what had happened in the above sessions it would be useful for us or we do have screenshots etc same for the groups also will know what has happened which all horses were connected and disconnected that information will be available but will we will not know which are she was able to present soap it would be great if all teacher or cease during todays breakout session accent outreach a small report as to which all are seas were absent or were unable to make their presentations it will be also helpful for us to contact them and try to get an alternate date for them to a give a presentation apart from the survey up regarding abu versions are kindly all or seize please note that we are currently using abu version number five so please ensure that you have a view version number five in your system otherwise they are going to be a lot of technical issues like the audio video disconnection and ladder features may not properly work there could be lord of armies matches in your ear so please ensure that all our seas i have a new version number five otherwise please go to the enemy a city site or where the latest downloads of the abu ater is available or you would also have been informed via email about abu guidelines so please make sure that your versions are correct thank you they spur university for the feedback a bill now move to a another roar or see yeah so this arcy one zero four one she mata vaishno devi university a katra jammu and kashmir new year in my opinion yes your audible pleas went in and taken while interacting apparent in the otter giant work group was not okay with you youre unable to hear our desktop or any kind of wouldnt happen okay another thing that an activity with to be in no time did pay the entire day for a can you repeat what you just said equally non activity had been planned over the whole day would be underpinned mountain i see it is not just the small activities it is r sees interacting with others i am getting more information and are refining their understanding about the blogs so for example are an important thing as external blogs could be embedded too a moodle blogs by using a a external body shape are you a using the blog a button also so obvious are something that we have seen is that even if it is a small activity at the interaction between different darcys is very usefull and very yout a i mean its not aminu maybe knowing lots of things but there are many others who may not be do knowing these specific aspects of the model of a tools which they would be we only if they interact and one more important thing is the purpose of the session is for or cease to interact with each other now when there are seas were interacting with each other you could actually look for okay ah ah we have participants who are in individual domain or is there someone in the in your ar see who are from the same domain so that we could work together all these kinds of interaction is also possible but it wouldnt happen because none of the presenter who presented their top hurriedly on ended some of those unable to hear you cry and who are able you will come presented on the mobile phone it oh how we can see that on mobile phone when nothing is visible on the mobile home residents who buy do that yes i reaction was i printed the year so i completely agree i completely understand seem all the horses are getting used to this modality of working together see one thing that i want to exhort through this app is that its not a one way transmission in terms when you you actually use technology you need to collaborate you need to explore the various ways in which you can actually work with different technology applications such so that it can benefit you now this for this there are some a teething problems like okay aadhar interaction time ah there were technological issues there were some disturbances may be the presenter the presenter view was not given so we are also see we are also in the process of learning iety bombay as a central hub is also learning a lot of new things through these interactions and da it is through these interactions that we can evolve and we are working towards empowering all the teachers are in use utilizing a platforms like aview for arp conducting or facilitating a interactive sessions now if tomorrow if you want to let it so some of the cases that one faculty shared yesterday was that she has eight different domains of students are taking the same class so can they stream the same class using ave you abuse a free and open source software so they all they need to do is download the code or application and install in their system so if people know how to utilize aview effectively that is something that you can explore in your own teaching learning practice in the future and that is one important thing that is something that is embedded inside the activities that you do so any new issues that you face itself is a learning experience so any challenge so for example in your students case also it may so happen that sometimes things may not work fine but through these difficulties through these challenges that is the place where the learning becomes maxim and that is the message that we want to give a cross to all are seized through these the in lab activity and breakout sessions yeah yeah ah let me go to ask one four five three allow allow yeah maybe i want to ask you one question regarding the polling feature you mentioned okay so that polling feature is not available right now in our view that is a because we are not a teacher that the reason or yes oh yes there is on some other reason you need to be a teacher arab are to actually get the polling functionality so ah yes eve if i am a teacher then i have a different software or i get a different access from your site so long the server side run from the server side you will get a different privilege which enables lot of different buttons that otherwise is not visible for students working up to add another thing is a recurring teaser today activity also wear this da thinking about the work which we did since yesterday and today yes also yesterday was the task given earth in our group eleven days we were supposed to do the workshop were a feature and we were able to do it yesterday and today morning we also completed our presentation in our group and so he ade it was a time in a sufficient term when there was sufficient time to do and then there was not a time remaining also okay choice you mentioned that a groups nor the different archives can communicate with each other thats the reason that you are keeping this a long time yes but a normally are doing what we understand is that if there is any complex problem then there is a scope of discussion but if we can do it ourselves then a discussion a requires amin a within the group if we can discuss then we may not be able to a need a discussion with the other axis choke a such activities can we deduce a cer these times a year from today to one day and weekend we can do this a this type of work or is it possible or you are you thinking this direction so also the question is can be reduced so the question asked by ars arcy one four five three is that many of these activities seem to be are taking less amount of time so maybe when hard when there is discussion if they are short activities the discussions happen pretty fast and it stops over there again we have lot of time remaining at the archive or something that all horses need to understand is that this is also time that between archives you can interact and you can show a lot more things you can discuss how it is applicable in your settings something that we are encouraging us that use this time to interact with each other and explore so if we say that we authors only one module that you have to ask a discuss it actually the idea is that okay at least ensure that at least one module gets discuss but if there is sufficient time take the time to learn little more about other modules or other things as well ah unfortunately we have been we cannot force all people to engage in exploratory discussions and that has never been done so the original teitan kitty model when it started was that it becomes information today transmission from mighty bombay and all are seas were passive listeners an through the safety release we are trying to make all a horse is also active so that they can explore themselves and what we intend is that once a teacher experiences this as a student they will do that as a teacher themselves similar practices with your students a where students are allowed to do open exploration students are allowed to do discussions students so initial or rules of discussions are made by us but after that students themselves use that platform to further increase a a their own knowledge about a particular tool so today we use moodle tomorrow we may use some other things and try to give you more time for discussion and da you explore the op the whole terrain of educational technology tools and applications thank you addressing my concerns so now i would like to give you won one feedback regarding my own experiencein a learning in a tipi won zero next and then applying it in my course okay so i knew it even zero next we had one or see activity in which we aim to create one a discussion forum yes soon after doing that in in in my university i teach in a impact program into a mobile communication a course so am i created one discussion forum and ask every student to participate in the discussion because we have our own boodle servers so in that the course is already created and we do i use moodle extensively yes so a what i found is the that are the lab activity was not given to them they carried out lab activity in lab and a dinner i asked them i ask where i created three groups in a my lab and an antenna also made one group leader and i asked them to a first post should dig by one group leader who asks and then others others will create a thread in that group leaders response okay so a also this way i tried to include a whatever ive learned in a pit even zero next in the practice of what ive found is that it is happening a simillar amin initial reaction is that they are finding that unless i force them they are not going to reply yeah i give them insight is that i will consider it as a term bookmarks and then only it will be considered so similar i am facing here also like gazi centres are also finding it i know it said matt it is it is a compulsion but i mean we are doing it like its like yale a because there is some sort of ancient iran it is just some feedback and sharing of asphyxia a thank you for sharing the feedback and yes as o all active learning strategies we need to have a buy in from are the learners so if you are doing these obsessions like pros of attack said the only because the abu sessions are mandatory we are having all haas is coming on a saturday all teachers in our seas coming on saturday and sunday and be perfectly understand that and since it is related so only if you attend every session will you be given certificate we also know that it even at it as art teachers you have to be a job a whole are participants have to be given sufficient incentive to move from a job they are our own standard format of information transfer too op students centered learning and we are using a our current incentives if you actually look at it we are using a the certificates and mandatory attendance both stick and carrot a have to be given to ensure that participation happens and this is the case even in a normal classroom see in normal classroom another problem with discussion forums is that they have war themselves to interact with you they have physical presence so many a times it may so happen that they may not need discussion forum to actually work or discuss the problem but where discussion forum might be more useful i suppose they are doing something in their system and they have to show that to the others that is where discussion forum becomes it becomes an asynchronous activity but that is where it has more power where it has more raw utility where it is tied to a particular activity that they were doing inside the lab at that moment how are you will have to see it it also depends on the context that means or what subject it was what time it was does a students or students very much involved in discussion kind of activity and traditionally a asians specifically indians are indian audience are they do not participate too much in written communication they do more it is more of an oral communication that has been the norm for almost a great amount of time due to which there is also attitudinal or belief based issue in participating in discussion forums but if you look to the west or to the other regions there are more tuned into the discussion based off a interactions and they will be readily participating in the discussion forum are now they also have additional utilities like whatsapp or facebook messenger facebook so that also leaves away the idea of discussion forums tied to a learning platform so if you had conducted the same discussion maybe in facebook the reaction might have been very different also again it really depends upon what works in that context a i appreciate the feedback that were given because yes it is correct or up in the initial it also has to be a habit we also have to understand that only when it becomes a habit will people be tuned to do the discussion now at least every participants know that saturday sunday is gone because i have abu interaction now from their time trying to move them towards oak there is a lab activity on saturday afternoon and other the breakout session which i have to do on sunday morning that we are trying to inculcate the habit slowly and steadily so that teachers also get used to these kind of practices and try to work with us but it is a slow process and we are doing it at a scale which also creates a large problem am even a smaller issue gets compounded big a year but so is the times i completely appreciate the feedback we will definitely try to refine the session because we are also learning a lot from these kind of sessions and i hope you will also be refining your home a practice based on whatever you are learning from eff dippy too as well thank you for the feedback or a wish you well in the courses that you are taking are in the upcoming semester year thank you thank you rip ya let me now go to a r see double one double zero a mrs pillay institute allow allows her a blow yesterday on resident lab a small floor very good we have very few a participant but all are very enthusiastic are in for our group so we got a wiki or activity noodle okay so they work at a are included session we couldnt participate we couldnt represent active buyer beware up presented but we give chance to other pound asses first also who are syscon brethren dark of a war but our she couldnt present okay or we will definitely get the cans were cleared from the native america will get a chance to present a washer and dryer and one more thing i would like to a specified year data or participants not only are stick to the activity which even by the given power grow midweek only but try to explore a lesson activity also earlier in the last lap session great so yeah i appreciate so i thank all the participants from your center because they took the initiative to obovoid and explore the other modules cuz this kind of inquisitiveness is what you need to instill in your own students for them to move up move ahead and this becomes even more important are in the scenario where our teachers are complaining of completion of syllabus see are when you give them probing activities where they are content creation or their ownership is there a many a time so ninety out a hundred times were seen that participants go beyond our own expectations and try to explore even further so people who have doubts regarding i have so much to complete but so much little time think of how to use active learning strategies in your own classroom which is known to give you these kind of benefits but yeah you need to install this as a habit maybe you need to give a lot more of these exercises get them used to it so that they can explore and there oh yes mom please continue to have one doubt is that if we are activity often domains are specified by add yes so are who they have two or do all the activities in moodle that particular in that particular domain motivator we are going to be a guess who they have all activities so we are activities so this is regarding the confessional regarding the domains domains means the group under the if its like a group so if you are less a mathematics teacher your activity will come under the mathematics domain and you need somebody else from mathematics to better understand and evaluate your modal activity so the domains is only a grouping mechanism through which you could you could get good evaluators from your same domain from our sites yeah thank you very much thank you thank you for the feedback i do congratulate the participants from your centre for exploring a please add them to explore all the other modules also avenue you have almost your eggs are thought of before the next interaction so you could use a lot of these modules to actually work and create better lesson plans hankies abandon ah let me now go to a horsey one three nine i net access pim college of engineering sindhudurg maharashtra are you not audible sir can you check your mike yeah please note even if we do have a given activity or workshop creation we have created workshop and waves use different assessment methods in that oak like rubrics also viewcreated oak and also we have ignored one another king dedede competency level oak grey competency level that data to a slowed know that good enough to put my suggestion is we are from mumbai university okay so for submission of tumour we normally you have we have the assignment writings on paper for experiments were to attack the printouts i guess okay so if if the mumbai university suggesting their syllabus only you have to were picked up a submissions or tumble submission through this model then that will be better so everywhere it will be company what your using slow change is slow yet we might more pasta ah i appreciate the suggestion that you have given but you know that mumbai university is also in the show because they did many of their assessments online but it is the eighth i am just joking say ah ah yes an institute we can always only recommend these kind of changes but if you have a lot of institutes under mumbai university who say that these kind of learning management system should be made activity in these kinds of learning management system should be made mandatory they should be standards then that is when the university will also look up and try to get sad get yours suggestions implemented in the policy say a policy wise if you actually look at our age it is they are encouraging online moocs etc even in the standard curriculum for students so you could add they are offering credit transfer from el pital of several universities are signing up memorandum of understanding with entitle for credit transfer for their students so this is actually slowly coming up so the moment a mumbai university sees that many other universities are taking this up these kind of a ledge avin a policies and practices a sure shot of going to be implemented or in your own system as well but see a policy is one thing which we do not have control of an it moves at its own pace there needs to be protocols the womens board meeting should be their syllabus revision or whatever committees have to be form need to understand the feasibility and at this juncture if you suggest something like this technology thing especially for evaluation of term work to mumbai university i am really doubtful whether they will actually listen to us at this moment but ya i will or i will definitely ask prosafe attack when he move goes to a meeting in mumbai university at least two or try to voice this opinion ah to the office officials over there so thats all what they do one thing i knew ya allow a because currently it is in film in sweden is going on for third year now would be from this academic year eighteen ninety lyrical film television in third year okay oh yeah so now you yeah we will try our level best at least to convince people or but at least put in a word from our side lets hope that they will listen to it and try to implement it as and when the syllabus revision happens somewhere it should be snorted then yes i agree unreasonable he drove on as an alternate why dont i suggest you as an institute at least at an institute level can you create a policy wherein your ra or internal examinations gets some vintage from moodle see what were doing it be a be harmless to peer in muddle venue created active duty and you muddle were conducting the activities for the suid oak park for improvement a placement thing okay he and another thing regarding feedback also we have used the wooden oak student feedback okay i then also we have different execution of different subjects that also conducted under nodes are said to the modern yes that wearer but regarding the submission of this tumblr can you think here using the traditional way of doing it it creates a lot of a donkey work also i heard her say ah i see why suggestion to all institutes who wantto or implement this i get this implemented at university level at least at a local institute level try to implement these and also a find effectiveness measures see just by implementing a thus alone all your work is reduced that is not a consideration for university to implement this in a blanket format what you should show is that by implementing these kind of mechanism theis effectiveness there is efficiency both in the system as well as in the learning you will have to show this if you dont have enough evidence to support this so this is base what we call evidence based advocacy so any any policy when it is form you will have to do small pilots collect appropriate data and identify the analysis methods through which it could be better analyzed and informed policymaking body okay so why dont you try doing this look at the number of users are what their feedback is regarding online examination or how much time has been said so for example if you do assessments on moodle how much time gets saved offer faculty are compared to how much time it will actually take to correct this manually and the give marks tabulated all the associated processes so this could be a different these measures could be an important op a policy important for the policy creators also okay for a women behave when we initially started this a wee piece not a problem from a girl need to not ready to accept equip it yonkers who will do that he have neat nobly intended he everything but somehow we have usefully implemented now the people forget habituated to that end we are now feeling easy to breed but a regarding using assessment now if you say im sick unify people a hundred questions in insecure if i manually i have to assume it takes so much time to work with it but he might conduct it through the muddle it definitely huge lot of time yeah but you need you should be telling the your institute authorities this rather than me i am convinced by your ra i am convinced that models should be used but it is the institute as amount see when they are putting this up it does for they have to look for all the you all the colleges they love to look for all the different colleges were these kind of issues are there and are all faculty training model that also we are not sure though these kind of considerations also have to be made see that is one problem at a top level when you make these kind of decisions or you will have to also look at several different factors other than just basic thing so how much time it does it take to train these people muddle all these have to be a considered by the university they have to say that by so and so here we are planning to implement model make sure that all your faculty get trained in moodle using moodle by that time so these kind of things have to be done by the university as a whole so yeah so we will try to convince or put in our own words are regarding the use of model lets see how are they going to take it up with a pinky yeah let me now go to a arcy one four five six by six week yes karpagam institutes karpagam institute of technology coimbatore beginnings would evening answer i like to thank you for the morning breakout session a bihar the interaction with the a or see one three five three and we have presented our work to the a mentor who is allotted to us okay and behave beyond mercury surgeries a byu presented our moodle or to the winter we couldnt get any feedback from them oh one more thing sarah after the zoo today interaction session if you have any query on the other weaknesses the topic what you uploaded new york on thursday coming thursday or in the next week before to the next review interaction session yes if you have any query to whom we have to write the meal a query regarding got a record in the course content or any doubts on the video so you uploaded now okay doubts say one thing is any course related matter we encourage you to use the itee bombay ex discussion forum a sometimes in discussion forum we couldnt find proper answers okay so if your answer you do ya so what we are also going to do is i lost my course team two repeat ortho theresa separate a ighty bombay discussion forum called chiari so click on all topics and you will find the site you will find a separate topic and called queries okay so you post your question in the queries are ill ensure that the course stays are will be there to handle these questions and you will be able to get a better feedback chosen as one more last year regarding the updip ones ruven a bill our participants those who completed only played the eligible percentage when shall we mentioned a get the certificates okay so offer all our seas information i had told this yesterday also but again repeating the fd one zero one next certificates have been a given for printing right now so we are expecting all the certificates to be ready by this weekend so in almost a weeks time we will start dispatching or the certificate from bombay also you should be getting by mid may a barb byrum twentieth may or it should a twentieth maine stupendous and bey you should be getting the certificates at your own remote center when tuition so let me now move to the nexts archi this gia arcy one zero eight zero zer i ity kukatpally hyderabad loops along with the icy teams members this is the trapezius muscles giving the report above thats today view programs of gases and exerts a tsa easy almost sent us these are the points that my words back to bring you your first point is that the total strength of this so our archicentre parchment is honey and this one it departments have been divided into three groups each group contains eight faculty of pakistan now serves as the force of yesterdays programs it is a house of class comprehension abundant preparations of further though we have this logic component the glossary component we have about the glossary and preparation about the preparation of speeches about the glossaries and also video creation and finally preparation of the quizzes are the four components of the content of the glossary and these four continents have given those eight groups of aesthetic regroups owned all his interestingly participated discuss among themselves and finally come out with their content and this content was further discussed and finally this was uploaded to the icy muddle to share recipes other office and also by city models and also the same measures given to our participants also so that they can go through the complete course material about the age discussion what digits during the session and after that sits in on todays program what happened that way whatever that handle the preferred yesterdays above that program our team leaders have apprised of all the points how it was discussed and a also they have shared the sunset with the other are se centers add to have the heat pads and also the same time we share the same content with the icing on the moon up and we got some good feedback on the other office centers and we have decided to incorporate that feedback for the present content to iservice dvd content folder will be equal partners future anders oh one more point the trade industry but what i want to say that we have very much inspired with the icy be models and the saints are on the same far away as the tsa aty as also a established ger i eity icity models and almost last year we have made many audi can say experiment serves to make it up for such the establishment and now from the current sun swan versus some coming from july onwards we are asking our faculty members to instructs us to the icy sea isle city models and all the content was ready and just only to launch the echoes through icity a generative model which is a just like sauce it is the bomb behind the rear very happy to inform you that this is with your inspiration boards these have started finally in overall the entire feedback that we got is a very good and overall the totals attendants and discussion everything reserves are done systematically and finally we have prepared the reports contents and upload it to the a models and on arts centers and wishes that the program is a very successful offer this two days we have enjoyed very much and we would like to thank to the eye the bombay and also to heresy or center for arranging very good arrangements for us thank you very much a possible congratulations to all the participants are ing your artsy you told me they were around hundred native participants are the course coordinator and the remote center coordinator a great kudos to both of them for managing the activities over the two days and make a ensuring that they are all engaged for this much amount of time it is also inspirational to hear from you that you have been motivated buyers and you have installed model in your ra or in your college but i would also want you to just go ahead even slightly further in telling you that the same engagement and the same enthusiasm that you have showed while you are participating in this hefty ppi you should ensure that your students will also get similar creation opportunities in their own classes and do not be restricted by curriculum timings etc because you know that the moment you are given an ownership like what you have seen if your students are also entrusted with ownership with small micro activities to start with or they can move over and be great learners as well as great teachers themselves are great facilitators themselves so i would want you to completely or take all the practices from us see our resources are in open source in creative commons so this is also another philosophy that we are trying to exhort to all remote centers you are all building you can build from each other or if your resources are kept in open and this refinement as to finally come back to the common so that somebody else can take it up and build on top of it so please ensure that your philosophy your practices also capture these elements of ati bombays philosophy so that your learners at the end who needs to be benefited will get the actual benefit from the resources the practices that you do with technology in your college or thank you sir for the feedback i hope all other horses are also listening to the feedback provided by the arcadia deity kukatpally i know many of you are doing many of these practices are also take a take this breakout session to inform other horses about these best practices but that is also something that each artsy should be doing and what has happened how you convince your management how you convince your learner these are important lessons that other archives can also take up and try in their own practice a thank you archie won zero is zero off ill now move on to the next a remote center or see one three six seven send vincent college nagpur adorable yes please guide you may want to adjust your mike are the video so that you are visible the camera so that your visible yellow white a grinning sir good evening yard in uday morning session we could not able to present a but you are now giving with the new dates thats okay urban query i serve i would like to ask you the last time a saboteur participants a miss thus every interaction session so they got mail from a puppy icity to submit the summary report yeah so after sabra submitted the summary report one of the participant the peel off after submitting the report she got disqualified so aqua interacted with helpline numbers but every time i act a helpline number ago interacted with a new person though and i it was very difficult to resolve that issue slaughter last moment that issue was the deer a deer it is all actually okay if the participant was suffered at that time so please give give some specific us helpline buses so that a weekends all our queries and it has basically yeah your request has been so we will ensure that at least this time around there is a consistent person to help yod see gently all the workshop team are available in our number zero two two two five seven six four nine eight nine this is the number or mobile answered the telephone number with which you can contact so if there is a very specific person one request that we are asking who is kindly ah when somebody is your calling someone please take the name of the person who is handling your issue okay so this will also help the workshop team also in the identifying the corresponding person and give the continue your interaction with the same person itself so always saw whenever you give a call to this since this the common number please also art get the name of the op a person from ati bombay with whom you are interacting okay so ya so but your op enquiry your query has been considered ill tell the workshop team to ensure that they tell their name to you first so that they will get to know with whom they interact hope oak ankel on let me now go to or see one four five nine university view see college ah putucusi tamil nadu allow japanese well today i am not able to present since we had a problem in our audio okay we have submitted the form taking three different aid okay donna sure sure so we will consolidate all these dates and the tomorrow one exercise that of the workshop theme will be looking at is finding a suitable date for all the different archive so that they can get at least one breakout session with another or see at least are two other artsy so that you could get a feedback form tomorrow i guess so if the session tomorrow so we have to check my mail by tomorrow morning itself so the session will not be tomorrow i mean we will at our end will consolidate all these requests tomorrow we need a day to actually process all the alternate dates that you have provided an a be will a will also have to schedule the ebu a groups also accordingly so that somebody is available as a teacher the others will be there a student and these interactions can happen work is no but you will be informed youll be informed of are the appropriate dates are tomorrow okay oh okay thank you yeah let me now go to a passive one four zero six ashrae etch weepy mandel college a artsy one four zero six your video is not being shown up yet please allow your hello yes we have get the time for internship but during the interaction at the time is over and we are not able to interact okay elusive yeah we admit able to interact even though we have group we have participated what interaction show due to short of time or the time limit we are not able to interact due to some sound do my problem with audio problem while checking at audio problem they slipped out the season and we are not able to interact and learn which grow which group were you in our group is group number tne okay hence we have created a the workshop activity year earner stress management and we hope we have created the two or three types of a breakup quiz we have added as well as the feedback also we have given these are the various types of content that we have added over there no one more fish one question that i would like to ask you sir yes sir as you said that we have to for the completion of we are activity we have to form the groups yes as far as number up to participate and the domains of respective participate yes are in are and see there are thirteen different to me its okay and that means shall we have to create that thirteen different type of courses and those courses and related matters we have to uploaded into the ansi be page as a model web page is it okay sir are no so this is to be that you execute that we are activity so the oya activities a group activity does not have a connection with the artsy sebi archi accompanies the artsy activities limited to the ebu sessions that you are doing or that we are activity something which the participant themselves have to form a group for all the participants themselves up to form a group and create a course in one of their so somebody will become a team leader or that person will have to create a moodle course the others will have to be core teachers are in that course and you should have some attest student ideas that you give off or wrap the cord so it is not at all related to a fab aussy model but one thing is that you can ask these participants to create in the arci model itself if you want all the wires to be in a single location yes this is what i supposed to cure i have to tell the number of groups as far as the domain and carry those things to your ear you out yes yes yes yes yes and we were out in order to complete that activity we have to complete that activity where they have to suppose to complete that activity so there will be doing it is indeed there will be doing this activity once they have created the course once they were completely uploaded all the resources they will also have to write a report and this has to be uploaded here when your iety bombay ex course so the rib a separate submission in a ighty bomback scores were only the team leaders will be able to submit and the derby a peer review of that particular activity location hopkins does kenny tailed seem activity to complete that activity and in and include that activity in my eyes and see yeah that is fine so if you want to include that in your ar see moodle a website that is fine it is not a problem issue but what is important is that the course has to be separately created by each of the oki over each participate each do before each domain how to create a current correct yes often thence to hexham a york activity will be given on twenty fourth of the week starting on twenty fourth because that is where the oya activities meant to start so you will also have your mentors also ready by the type and by twenty seventh opt your participants can interact with their mentors and get more understanding about the we are activity a um can i should tell you can ask one more patient observer how should i know that who is the mentor of each group are so young so the mayan coordinators will also be kept in loop as ah ah so he outreach will be sending out an email to the course coordinator telling who are the mentors and from your offer the participants from yuvraj and moon move questions here as we who created the muted hues in the same type of tombs moodle moodle ga i begun to implement in our college voted the prerequistes for that as we have created this moodle under pleat front yard is provided when you need to you need to have a server which can host the moodle or application and you need to have a moodle administrator who knows in and out of model how to organize model for an institution in a specific software that i need merely have this announcer you need to get services from companies who are offering model packages too are institutions or if you have a job i team in your raw college see many of our many of the horses are in your group have installed model in their own colleges suggests just two interactions bag we had heard of are are ger i ity kukatpally who are installing or who have installed moodle in their own college so i would are specifically request you to interact with these horses and get the information because there will be able to tell you the very specific details based on institution what all things they did what all are the best practices etc rather because za at our end we have trained you in creating courses in moodle moodle installation requires a lot more a broad details it requires it to the workshop on its own so a the the current time will not suffice for explaining you what is required so what i would request you is your scene are seeing a of generality i would encourage you to contact them and get the necessary details okay that is also one thing that you should be using the breakout sessions for oak kitchen yes yoki ah let me now go to or see one four two seven upi college of engineering coimbatore wood wood eating enemy yes unable to view some monkey suppression and we have a suggestion here with our room we were discussing and we are giving the presentation of bookshops i said okay and if there is a mix of hurt if there is a mix of activity will be a groups i think itll be better so the derby and knowledge transfer for other activities like glossary database even reveals also yeah so are so the question posted by r says that if if interaction could have been different that would have help see that is exactly what your going to do next week i will be posting all the moodle courses created by other ares is in the iati bobex page or during in the upcoming week when the activities released for the next week so i would encourage all participants to go through all those activities are these activities have been created with the mindset that you are all teachers and you would like to know what other activities are so you should take this opportunity to first learn from what others have done and also give them feedback as to how that particular course could improve so i completely appreciate the feedback that you are given right now so you should give similar feedback to your ra other arses as to how they could improve a a the moodle a course so that it is more meaningful and you learn a lot more things and why your participants are actually looking through the courses i would also recommend that they are you yourselves look at multiple resources so one set of people look at our resources provided by lets a one or see on glossary one another or see on the arm on wikis etc so that among yourselves also youll see the variation of work done by different darcys year beginning jackie can hear me yes i can give these were only two suggestions year persephone yukos is worki yana attending we are we can gain multiple knowledge on hooky but the suggestion number one is the certificate provided by you will begin bonus novak can yet what we will be helpful to us in any appraisal will be there after leading used kid elderly promotion so can you suggest some of the policies to oasis it would be more valuable to us and goes yeah yeah yeah what is your second suggestion a second bonus uses the discussion forum is on both disagrees in sandys one suggestion is why we have a discussion forum for nobody on sunday because already you hav i debate suggestions queries forum medicine yet so still we have any queries or doubts better will boost the instead of having it for the entire day there is minute second suggestion okay okay let me address the concern regarding certificate so are the certificate that we are issuing i think all horses are many other participants they are submitting these certificates as a valid certificate for faculty development a a which is mandated as per the career advancement scheme also this is a two week equivalent each course is a two week equivalent certificate so you will you can show total of four weeks of faculty development activity and one important thing when you are attending a four week a or a two week course a this one particular day you are getting through these discussions you are getting one day of activity that is the equivalency the course across a week is equal and only to eight hours or for it why to six hours of a teaching learning material it is not worth more than that so if you want to complete the sow with four weeks you can only online mode you will be able to completely foreign to six twenty four hours which is actually a much four days four days worth interaction or four days worth face to face faculty development program a the we are activity which actually transcends across two weeks will be considered for extra effort because that requires discussion and that is counted towards some more days and it is the four days are also four days of interaction that you have in the safety that is counted towards the total two weak equivalence on a two week equivalent program you will have ten days of face to face your supposed to have ten days of a face to face interaction and classes now this four days will be used for that or what is a count towards that too weak equivalence certificate so unless and until we can we do not schedule these interactions are you will not be eligible for a two week equivalent certificate so in terms of certificate that is the problem number one regarding discussion a second problem i suppose you do the same to your own students saying that okay are you discuss i will you can use the mode lets you create a caution wouldng anew tell to your students that you can use the moodle discussion forum to a a clarify your doubts so you dont need to come to class will they be coming to class at any point of time so yazoos none is what we are seeing the blended program is meant four because this face to face interaction is important you speaking to another person has a lot of value the human element has a lot of value whatever technology we bring in maybe incorporate latest artificial intelligence into ide xbox platform nothing can replace the human element of it cause you learned a lot from your colleagues your peers so that is why we are keeping these are the that is the most important reason that we are keeping these interactions on saturdays and sundays where we know that other one be regular academic activities for many of the participants in the program anda regarding diverse resources four discussion a i think a we are keeping that diverse resources activity for next a view interaction so off you will see all these diverse resources a in the coming days and up one more thing is a as i said earlier not all participants are very active a native of becks discussion across their dips we have always seen that the percentage of active participants summer between forty to sixty percentage of the total enrolled so somebody else looking at and giving you feedback is again it will take some more time for them to get used to the platform get used to the habit of participating in discussion only the queen yeah please wait if you are very useful enough to know who and getting more knowledge in one connecting newcomb new highly on needle having on my my myyahoo nudger thank you so ya so this is one more benefit if somebody one of your colleague it herself is saying that they get benefited through the discussion so i hope that answers the main query that you had thank you or see one four two seven or so there is one more or see who is active abuses go college of engineering a thank you for staying so late it is five twenty three and thank you for patiently listening to the various queries and answers please c would evenings reading we had a sick participants in open and yesterday we really enjoyed doing in an activity where each of our participants put in their efforts and we designed our moodle course we had a lot of pink features presentations a screencast video a quiz all designed by the participant itself and put up we also linked it waywardness thigh arm and the roads identified as presenters intact a groupie year however due to weather conditions we had a pa shut down in the morning in south goa okay because of which we could not login have we missed the breakout session who may be the alternate days that we have given our choice in the feedback the alternate sessions we will be given an opportunity we would be happy yashua so we are will work towards finding a single day were all of you could be accommodated so if in that case you may not have to spend maybe not more than two and half hours if there are only few people then you could complete the interaction of in less than three hours and also get sufficient feedback from your colleagues on how these activities are and how the different resources are what will also do is mail puttock put this up or in it a bomb back so that a along with user credentials test user credentials so that other participants can also access your moodle course and give you feedback on that so please ensure that you have a feedback module created in your rub a module ideally given link to a google form so that each participant see theres only one test student id so each participant will be using the test student id so give a google form so that you could get feedback from individual participants were logging into the course and we will work on that yeah okay anyway thank you when youre so thank you go engineering college of soap i believe that we come to the end of todays session are luckily we are still in times of year are completing at beyond a before five thirty up to all the remote centers were unable to present sorry for the we apologise for the technological inconveniences that you face but will also ensure that we will accommodate you in the coming week and will try to give you up presentation slot are exceptional cases do not worry we will or will handle the exceptions of a because this is one important activity that you should be doing ab as part of the afc the interactions between nazis and information sharing and the best practices a more detailed guidelines on how to do breakout a how to do a local activity etc we will inform you in the coming weekly release where we will put up a some best practices some are more instructions to make this more lively or in the meantime a please submit the feedback i heard about todays breakout activity the course coordinators from each are sees are requested to submit the feedback so that we can collect it and consolidated to give you an alternate
