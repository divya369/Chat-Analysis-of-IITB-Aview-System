       " 'thats not the case so in order to achieve that we need a story in every explanation what were trying to make i dont mean that you have to always talk about be king and queen and all that but you need to connect with people with some interesting thing and what is the story typically so if you analyze that a typical film story goes like this we have the boy fitting the girl we have the girl is ignoring a boy and the boys trying to try something new there are some plots by the boy to get the girl and the plot will work and there is happily ever after right below the standard story now if i translate that to what happens actually at the psychological level then it is the setup it is the conflict where a the ignorance happens',\n",

       " 'no idea should be discarded at this phase',\n",
       " 'just keep writing later on when youre done with that time slot of brainstorming you can find the relationship between the topics and there if you find no relationship or a certain point which is written they can discard it but not at the time off when people are suggesting for example there is a room of a having five or six people were brainstorming on a particular idea and theyre saying certain a points to be added the person who is writing he or she should not comment right away by saying oh maybe this is slightly farfetched or maybe this is not connected to this so maybe we should when you should avoid these',\n",
       " 'dont take such a judgmental call at that stage',\n",
       " 'just keep writing them after your done with that and with time we put a time limit so that we dont go endlessly on that and after that just try to find out relationship between the so what are typically the points which will go the introduction what are typical point which is about the problem or related work or the solution a proof something like that then you should be able to generate a flow out of these buckets which you have collected while based on this the interesting idea and one of the tools in order to make this is called my dads so mind maps will help you in categorizing and analyzing the particular topic of throwing up ideas and without any hierarchy so to see why i am saying that is because mindmap doesnt tell you about a hierarchical structure so it is everything is thrown at one point and then you can just decide they are collateral based on the audience',\n",

       " 'there is the audience which right now when im talking to you all you all being teachers i will re position my presentation in the way which is different than when i will use the same presentation or the topic when i am talking to students so this kind of orientation will change for the same content also sometimes and thats where the structure of the presentation makes a very important a role in doing so let us take an example here if you all are there and ready for typing out something have a look at this slide you can see some alphabets on screen right now in the alphabets if i tell you that after a period of thirty five seconds of forty seconds i am going to switch off the slide unable to ask you tell me number of each of the alphabet are in in this set what i am sure i want how many age where their honey bees see when devan yes and all that how will you try to remember this set and re create it for me',\n",

       " 'just keep writing later on when youre done with that time slot of brainstorming you can find the relationship between the topics and there if you find no relationship or a certain point which is written they can discard it but not at the time off when people are suggesting for example there is a room of a having five or six people were brainstorming on a particular idea and theyre saying certain a points to be added the person who is writing he or she should not comment right away by saying oh maybe this is slightly farfetched or maybe this is not connected to this so maybe we should when you should avoid these',\n",
       " 'dont take such a judgmental call at that stage',\n",
       " 'just keep writing them after your done with that and with time we put a time limit so that we dont go endlessly on that and after that just try to find out relationship between the so what are typically the points which will go the introduction what are typical point which is about the problem or related work or the solution a proof something like that then you should be able to generate a flow out of these buckets which you have collected while based on this the interesting idea and one of the tools in order to make this is called my dads so mind maps will help you in categorizing and analyzing the particular topic of throwing up ideas and without any hierarchy so to see why i am saying that is because mindmap doesnt tell you about a hierarchical structure so it is everything is thrown at one point and then you can just decide they are collateral based on the audience',\n",

       " 'the question is that what are the different things which will stop students from learning so first and foremost is the a the boredom which accumulates over time so i like i said if your presentation lacks the engagement pointers in between so like if you see every presentation should have a point where the students feel connected to it in somewhere the other and that will only come through participation so if you are going to create a representation which has a monologue like you speak continuously on one side and dont bother whether people are sleeping on the other side when it is definitely stop people from derby it is observed and well researched fact that a students learn or anybody learns by participating so your presentation should have ample opportunity of participation and that will definitely connect them with this and they will never stop learning as you said so that is one sure shot way and the second wave in connection to what our presentation i just give is because of the a the kind of visual what you see on screen also creates the boredom at times for example',\n",

      "you can just use a plain sheet of paper also you dont have to use a very sophisticated equipment for that and arm you can also ask one of you to volunteer and right on the whiteboard or blackboard whatever is available and just keep throwing ideas but the important point at this stage is that you dont have to be judgmental while doing this so it is very important that you dont decide to discard idea or to keep idea being judgment : [[0.9988678 0.0011322]]\n",
      "no idea should be discarded at this phase : [[0.98672074 0.01327925]]\n",
      "just keep writing later on when youre done with that time slot of brainstorming you can find the relationship between the topics and there if you find no relationship or a certain point which is written they can discard it but not at the time off when people are suggesting for example there is a room of a having five or six people were brainstorming on a particular idea and theyre saying certain a points to be added the person who is writing he or she should not comment right away by saying oh maybe this is slightly farfetched or maybe this is not connected to this so maybe we should when you should avoid these : [[0.55267245 0.44732752]]\n",

      "you cannot be specific because i have not given you the context and thats why all the answers are ringing in the zone of just a brush because women as a bristles and a cleaning you remember a brush right now depends on the content very correctly said by college of engineering in good to add that it depends on the context : [[0.96393025 0.03606975]]\n",
      "i suppose i give your context well so i give your context that i want something for teeth something for face and something for people know what will you use for teeth : [[5.6442776e-04 9.9943554e-01]]\n",
      "obviously you will use the toothbrush i and what will use for face that would be be shaving brush and was of the women in the audience used to be the answer that they would use a makeup brush which is also correct a and a fight of our paper or a wall or something then that would be the painting rests also depends on the context that the same product has to be redesigned in order to satisfy the requirement of that particular surface that is how exactly we should take our decision in terms of presentation in terms of graphics in terms of colour everywhere depending on the context we should take a call off what we are going to use therefore its not that one is more important than other both are important but if you give less attention or inadequate attention to either of them then you will not be able to communicate properly on the other hand if you give excess attention then it will lead to a complete chaos and that is what we should avoid always therefore the content and is a very important and thats why it has a green dot the content for the given audience should govern the decision of choosing what visual your going to do use what design are able to follow and what strategy you are going to apply so it also depends on for example the moment i am teaching or am using a view then i should know that strategy should be of using the chat which is available here and then i can interact with you all images so depends on the audience how your going to conduct your communication skills are tested in such condition very much : [[0.99243987 0.00756015]]\n"

      "most of the things are already very eased out however i see that most of the faculty members dont use the templates and thats where things go wrong or start going wrong so my sincere request is that use a template and copy your entire contents because the biggest problem what faculty members have ease of transporting the content from one presentation to oligopolies : [[0.9568027  0.04319729]]\n",

      "we dont have to really worry about is the font size correct or add it has to be changed or something they will automatically get you the font sizes according whether it is the second level point third level point fourth well point it will allow you to use it automatically so that is a good suggestion thank you they will be a content and will be defended at two things in southern fiction so my infact voiles you that you concentrate on content creation at some point and later on whenever you are done you can so for example people who are well versed with latech they will agree to these vicadin latic : [[9.9984574e-01 1.5424067e-04]]\n",

      "the question is that what are the different things which will stop students from learning so first and foremost is the a the boredom which accumulates over time so i like i said if your presentation lacks the engagement pointers in between so like if you see every presentation should have a point where the students feel connected to it in somewhere the other and that will only come through participation so if you are going to create a representation which has a monologue like you speak continuously on one side and dont bother whether people are sleeping on the other side when it is definitely stop people from derby it is observed and well researched fact that a students learn or anybody learns by participating so your presentation should have ample opportunity of participation and that will definitely connect them with this and they will never stop learning as you said so that is one sure shot way and the second wave in connection to what our presentation i just give is because of the a the kind of visual what you see on screen also creates the boredom at times for example : [[9.9907774e-01 9.2226104e-04]]\n",
      "if you see something very interesting then students dont feel like we are not part of it so every time you show something if it is a catching their eyes in terms of what heading your giving what all font sizes your used if it is too small people cant read it then they give up and theyll say its a very boring lecture and i do want to listen to it : [[0.9963036  0.00369641]]\n",

      "whatever you think about the topic you just have to write it down and a you have to just throw them on piece of paper and or a board or a nowadays people are just use post it and keep it there : [[0.98965675 0.01034324]]\n",
      "you can just use a plain sheet of paper also you dont have to use a very sophisticated equipment for that and arm you can also ask one of you to volunteer and right on the whiteboard or blackboard whatever is available and just keep throwing ideas but the important point at this stage is that you dont have to be judgmental while doing this so it is very important that you dont decide to discard idea or to keep idea being judgment : [[0.9988678 0.0011322]]\n",
      "no idea should be discarded at this phase : [[0.98672074 0.01327925]]\n",
      "just keep writing later on when youre done with that time slot of brainstorming you can find the relationship between the topics and there if you find no relationship or a certain point which is written they can discard it but not at the time off when people are suggesting for example there is a room of a having five or six people were brainstorming on a particular idea and theyre saying certain a points to be added the person who is writing he or she should not comment right away by saying oh maybe this is slightly farfetched or maybe this is not connected to this so maybe we should when you should avoid these : [[0.55267245 0.44732752]]\n",
      "dont take such a judgmental call at that stage : [[0.90553415 0.09446585]]\n",
      "just keep writing them after your done with that and with time we put a time limit so that we dont go endlessly on that and after that just try to find out relationship between the so what are typically the points which will go the introduction what are typical point which is about the problem or related work or the solution a proof something like that then you should be able to generate a flow out of these buckets which you have collected while based on this the interesting idea and one of the tools in order to make this is called my dads so mind maps will help you in categorizing and analyzing the particular topic of throwing up ideas and without any hierarchy so to see why i am saying that is because mindmap doesnt tell you about a hierarchical structure so it is everything is thrown at one point and then you can just decide they are collateral based on the audience : [[0.9722675  0.02773246]]\n",

      "obviously you will use the toothbrush i and what will use for face that would be be shaving brush and was of the women in the audience used to be the answer that they would use a makeup brush which is also correct a and a fight of our paper or a wall or something then that would be the painting rests also depends on the context that the same product has to be redesigned in order to satisfy the requirement of that particular surface that is how exactly we should take our decision in terms of presentation in terms of graphics in terms of colour everywhere depending on the context we should take a call off what we are going to use therefore its not that one is more important than other both are important but if you give less attention or inadequate attention to either of them then you will not be able to communicate properly on the other hand if you give excess attention then it will lead to a complete chaos and that is what we should avoid always therefore the content and is a very important and thats why it has a green dot the content for the given audience should govern the decision of choosing what visual your going to do use what design are able to follow and what strategy you are going to apply so it also depends on for example the moment i am teaching or am using a view then i should know that strategy should be of using the chat which is available here and then i can interact with you all images so depends on the audience how your going to conduct your communication skills are tested in such condition very much : [[0.99243987 0.00756015]]\n",

      "the gentleman is asking is that you have showed me the presentation about communication skills so that is okay but what with if i have a presentation to make on microprocessor or something on algorithms or some biotechnology subject where there is lot of technical content involved and there is no liberty of like what you were using various colors and fonts and all that we dont have that choice so precisely sir what you have ares is very correct and a the the thumb rule still goes in the same manner if you look at the video which had a posted on moodle it shows that use of minimum number of fonts and minimum number of colors and using the grid lines in order to have a well designed layout of the slides adds to a clearer communication any which way whatever the content in arm in the store so i would like to give you another example : [[0.00963286 0.9903671 ]]\n",
      "if you read a novel especially english novels then you can see that they are all printed in black and white there is no color there are no images there is hardly any sketch there but still you can read that infact lot of people tell me that they love to read the novel but they hate the movie when it is made so imagine the situation from that novel they upgraded the very nice looking movie which all special effects and color and acting and voice and sound and everything but you still enjoy the blackandwhite novel which can read and you are free to visualize or get the message across so nicely so it depends on the clarity of your presentation rather than clutter of the content so no one thumb rule is that keep it simple keep minimum number of fonts minimum number of colors and have a eye pleasing layout so that the the slides look easy : [[9.9982065e-01 1.7933072e-04]]\n",

      "pratishthan has come up with a suggestion of using google material design so like i was telling in the moodle video which have uploaded that nowadays with the availability of templates : [[0.00452229 0.99547774]]\n",
      "most of the things are already very eased out however i see that most of the faculty members dont use the templates and thats where things go wrong or start going wrong so my sincere request is that use a template and copy your entire contents because the biggest problem what faculty members have ease of transporting the content from one presentation to oligopolies : [[0.9568027  0.04319729]]\n",
      "can you tell me something which can be done in the same presentation : [[0.7011735  0.29882652]]\n",
      "theyre very happy to use it : [[0.9980715  0.00192853]]\n",
      "if i tell them that okay transport your presentation to this one which has a better template better layout better color better fonts then thats a lot of extra work to be done but i feel that it is important to do that because that will only help you in removing the clutter and are using the the well researched guidelines offer presentation and like what you said these tools are created using these guidelines already : [[0.04615326 0.95384675]]\n",
      "we dont have to really worry about is the font size correct or add it has to be changed or something they will automatically get you the font sizes according whether it is the second level point third level point fourth well point it will allow you to use it automatically so that is a good suggestion thank you they will be a content and will be defended at two things in southern fiction so my infact voiles you that you concentrate on content creation at some point and later on whenever you are done you can so for example people who are well versed with latech they will agree to these vicadin latic : [[9.9984574e-01 1.5424067e-04]]\n",
      "you are completely free from are the design part you just have to keep doing the content and if you use the appropriate tags the presentation will automatically show up in that format refit the heading it will always show the heading in a particular font and all that thats a beautiful way of planning things thanks we have marathwada institute of technology but machine each a menu will be water the different hes newer view that ops wouldnt from lousy soil repeat the question for the benefit of the rest of the participants who are listening to this : [[0.9968813  0.00311871]]\n",
      "the question is that what are the different things which will stop students from learning so first and foremost is the a the boredom which accumulates over time so i like i said if your presentation lacks the engagement pointers in between so like if you see every presentation should have a point where the students feel connected to it in somewhere the other and that will only come through participation so if you are going to create a representation which has a monologue like you speak continuously on one side and dont bother whether people are sleeping on the other side when it is definitely stop people from derby it is observed and well researched fact that a students learn or anybody learns by participating so your presentation should have ample opportunity of participation and that will definitely connect them with this and they will never stop learning as you said so that is one sure shot way and the second wave in connection to what our presentation i just give is because of the a the kind of visual what you see on screen also creates the boredom at times for example : [[9.9907774e-01 9.2226104e-04]]\n",
      "if you see something very interesting then students dont feel like we are not part of it so every time you show something if it is a catching their eyes in terms of what heading your giving what all font sizes your used if it is too small people cant read it then they give up and theyll say its a very boring lecture and i do want to listen to it : [[0.9963036  0.00369641]]\n",
      "i would rather skip the slick so in order to avoid that method you have to make sure that you attract their attention to the topic youre discussing and then are you can ensure that it stays the same way by introducing participation in every presentation what your making the ride like to know that no there is lot of research happening based on the learning styles : [[0.93896955 0.06103046]]\n",
      "i thinker your showing us : [[0.24505132 0.7549487 ]]\n",

      "sagittarian can stick so no in general in india are near any girl across the country which kind of learners and more even though it is blended learning kenny or throw some light on this week a modern learning learning styles specialist okay so i will repeat the question for the benefit of others or what are the learning styles typically found in india is part of the question and i think specifically you asked about the vehicular be ah i am are really sorry but i am not very sure about the vehicle running part but with water experience i have a in teaching in the classroom as well as adapting to this side of a blended learning which we are right now doing so i am talking to a large crowd simultaneously and the books style of teaching where we dont even talk to people at all so the only way communication happens is through discussion forums so i have actually a just completed a course on a thready animation and which i am going to do a formal announcement in tomorrows session but just because the topic came up right now i tried these three teaching styles in the short span of one year a last one year ive been doing this activity as a full time research and to see the pros and cons of all these things and one thing i realize is that without a personal interaction with learner it is very difficult to communicate or to establish a engagement level with anybody so i wondered how many bullets we should have ideally in one slides how many words it should contain the question was is there a standard about how many bullets should be there in one slide : [[0.06166301 0.93833697]]\n",

      "you are forced to use some seven points probably if your topic talks about seven important issues related to something when you may have to add seventh point but that should be a rare according to a researcher which is given at the bottom ah they say that a human cannot remember more than six points if they are bombarded on today so therefore avoid more than six points on a slide and within the site also it should not be having more than six words at that time write : [[0.99823964 0.00176036]]\n",
