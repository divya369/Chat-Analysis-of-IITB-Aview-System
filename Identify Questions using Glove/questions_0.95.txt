color is is horrible right ardiss
how many people find that this position of the logo is also not very correct
can you withstand such a presentation for so long
how is this light so i am going to talk about use of text and graphics in most of the documents well
how many people have read this article a year back
why do you want to print you want to print because somebody should be able to read it now
can you see this text which is on this gray and white backgrounds
you cannot see white text on white so use of background is very important and at times your to take a very clear call about whether you require a background or not that is the thing that week i decided that will focus on these aspects in this small little module about visual communication using text and graphics while i would like to take you back to a smaller but very important component of a presentation which is the process and typically it should start with the planning phase where you plan a presentation
how do you want to execute it
like what is the outline
what are the details of a bullets
youre going to add all that and finally you decide on the template which will allow you to change font color add graphics and other things right invariably what people do is follow the reverse process they start with color schemes and typography and i have seen people spending a lot of time on the front slide like what color should be choose
what font should reward image should be added there
do you want these number of sites here or should i delete them or sticks
how will that correct behave
nobody is interested in getting that therefore you need to follow a particular way of storytelling so that people will appreciate the way you have communicated your thoughts and it is only possible because everyone including students as well as a reviewers whom who are judging you will love stories always that is why we need to see how we can make that outline as interesting as possible so that people would be able to communicate and see whatever is happening and then communicate back to us right so in order to get that position we need to stress upon the plan phase very much and one of the techniques i use most of the time is brain storm now in the brainstorming phase
if you want you can have a farm a small group and try it out at your own remote centers or within your other peer groups cuz
what would be the technique
can you try out
what is the technique you use
what will you use in order to remember these alphabets and tell be back fits kind of a memory to suppose
how will you do that
i want you to give bear a solution which can be used for example if i give you an exam
you dont have mobile camera that the time then how will you do this year
if i tell you tell with alphabets from this set and you will just say right computer science and engineering and tell me that okay all of these are the alphabets right now this is by the way a internet anagram server which helps you in doing this
if i show you this mind map directly the same guidelines are explained using this and this becomes more user friendly for people to understand so you can use a link you can use color you can emphasize and add images and you can have various dimensions to it
you can use keywords and use of apparent over will help in giving importance there can be different styles
your font size access are not clearly visible
i think a range in why access is a proggier swathing couple of people are coming up very right and if i change the scale i dont actually have to talk about the value of to fifty thousand if nothing at least here in white to show all these values right so i just reduce the why access to ten thousands and now you know what i can actually see a this particular dip here which was not visible in the earlier graph at all the editors dropdown in nineteen fifty below six how did which was not visible at this very simple and very common problem but most of the time people forget to use these techniques in order to explain what they wanted to say
which will make you think oh
what was the topic of this presentation
what was the over topic when we were a starting of this presentation so let just unwind a bit what we wanted to tell you was that whenever you are using a presentation transition especially are in impress
what are your time to come
even this slide has a green dot which means that this is the guideline slide and you can use this slide as a guideline slide which you can just compress all by presentation slides to one presentation and keep them handy so that he can utilize it whenever you are in trouble all want to solve something okay so based on this we can just have a look at the very famous debate of form and function what is a form is
how do you show the message and what is the function
what exact isms so for example
i want to inviscid is a bunch of bristles to clean or apply then what could be the the solution for that
what what would be your answer
what should be the form of that
if the function is of a bunch of bristles to either clean or to apply something what would be the form you would recommend any just type in your answers for the riff
i suppose i give your context well so i give your context that i want something for teeth something for face and something for people know what will you use for teeth
i would like to stop here for this particular topic and i would like to a now tell you about the activity you are going to do today and are in between if there are some questions i would like to take those questions please
how can i get credit so the question has done okay so i will repeat the person you are saying that you have downloaded some powerpoint slides from internet and you dont know the source of that
so how will you give credit for that presentation the website wherever you have downloaded from is also one of the ways you can referred me back so if you have downloaded from for example slideshare you will come to know that it has been uploaded by ex login name you can refer to that name and that is also good enough because sometimes people will anonymously a put up some content at that time you have to refer to the website but when you refer to it you have to say in bracket as seen on swine so date on this website that is would ideally you should write to the person who has uploaded and ask their permission on an email that i would like to use certain slide from your presentation for this purpose
thats what we have today for my slides
can he plot or either mathematics probability
is that what we are to take while making the presently hell yeah i have understood
the gentleman is asking is that you have showed me the presentation about communication skills so that is okay but what with if i have a presentation to make on microprocessor or something on algorithms or some biotechnology subject where there is lot of technical content involved and there is no liberty of like what you were using various colors and fonts and all that we dont have that choice so precisely sir what you have ares is very correct and a the the thumb rule still goes in the same manner if you look at the video which had a posted on moodle it shows that use of minimum number of fonts and minimum number of colors and using the grid lines in order to have a well designed layout of the slides adds to a clearer communication any which way whatever the content in arm in the store so i would like to give you another example
we have another question from a vidya pakistan bhanumati
pratishthan has come up with a suggestion of using google material design so like i was telling in the moodle video which have uploaded that nowadays with the availability of templates
if i tell them that okay transport your presentation to this one which has a better template better layout better color better fonts then thats a lot of extra work to be done but i feel that it is important to do that because that will only help you in removing the clutter and are using the the well researched guidelines offer presentation and like what you said these tools are created using these guidelines already
how the visual content is there any particular research done
