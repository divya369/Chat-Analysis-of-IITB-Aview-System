but earlier that is something that we need to emphasize to ourselves first and adopt a teaching methodology which will involve students which will be student sentry a learner centric and which therefore will emphasize activities discussions collaborative problem solving and so it is in this direction that you will find this workshop on pedagogy will take you further many of you must have already understood the importance of pedagogy many of you might have been already practicing it but this is where we collectively apply your mind and become ardent followers of a well defined so thats the first thing that i would like to emphasize repeat technology is very nice very useful but it is useful only provided there is an associated pedagogy which has been well tested well established and therefore well adopted by all of us in our teaching learning process the second point is when in learner centric moocs we talk about collaboration between learners it goes without saying that there must be collaboration amongst teachers it will give an example of a course which in most colleges is taught by multiple teachers a first course in computer programming which is an obligatory course for all students of any branch of whinging are typically five or six teachers would teach that course in y the system we have a single teacher addressing the students in two batches but earlier we used to have multiple teachers invariably these teachers would come together at least once a week discussed the common problems decide on the corrective course of action sometimes i observe a weak student in my class and decide on an approach which helps that student if i share that with my other colleagues they might have similar cases and my solution might not have occurred to them collaboration therefore is an extremely important aspect of the modern teaching learning process even if i am teaching a course alone doesnt it make sense for me to go back and talk to other colleagues have taught that courts earlier or some other colleagues who might be teaching that course in future consequently i would strongly suggest that develop the ability to collaborate and cooperate with others it will give you an opportunity to discuss pertinent points that you have observed i had to learn similar party in points from others who have observed these or have come up with these while handling their own teaching learning classes to emphasize this collaboration in this particular workshop you would be required to do a team assignment i think youre all familiar with it jacob will be elaborating it further it will primarily be concerning creation of an ohio but the essential idea is that you work in a collaborative fashion traditionally we have assumed collaboration to be possible only when you are physically together as a team such as colleagues in a college or students in a classic but modern technology permits collaboration to be effectively carried out even if you are at distant places email is just one example there are a large number of collaborative tools for example i think moodle is something that you have been trained to use in the last workshop i believe jackie plans to use moodle extension while bottle is a very good platform to contribute individually is also a good platform to work collaboratively in terms of teams and groups and that is something that is very very instead of just a wordpress add hoc collaboration or a confused collaboration as i call it where you to benefit a little but nothing of substance is remembered later i would suggest that each one of you should maintain a small diary apart from other thing that you right there you should write down the best practices that you observe whether theyre among the teachers tonight is a step or whether theyre from your own colleagues in your institute or whether theyre kelly participates each one of you would have done something useful something different but it is effectively only with you share it with others and do learn from others what the best practices why is it imported while we might generally be aware of the best practices we tend to forget those which come from elsewhere and we tend to promote ourselves that is not correct best practices have we learned from the best in the world it doesnt matter who is doing what good thing where as long as that good thing is useful it is therefore important that during this workshop we also try to make a compendium of best practices that you absorb that your lord that your heard i think it will be useful to you in your future teaching the third point that i wish to stress is the open educational resource all of your familiar with via open educational resource in fact the whole open source world particularly the world of content under the open source creative commons licenses beware sysonby essay early jet entire wikipedia is an example i will like to mention two things about open educational resource one is using open educational resources wherever available please remember that the number of such resources are very mean you do a single google search and you will get thousands of articles thousands of explanations thousands of tutorials if you barely give all such differences to your students and ashok that you have done your job of exposing suites open educational resource it would be a very very sad thing you know itll be sad big because like us students also only twentyfour hours a day like us they can only read or peruse through a few things in their spare time that is available recall our own student days even those days in good libraries there would be thousands of books any subject therapy six or seven books as students did we ever read although six or seven valleys some subjects which were of great interest to us perhaps we might have read more than two or three books but did we not as students use the maximum beneficial as a reading to our advantage recharge like guidebooks we chose like fixed prescribed textbooks which was like books from which most of the questions in the exams will appear this is a natural optimization that any student will do consequently it is not only important that you create the complete list collection of all open educational resources available in your feed and of course you make them available as a compendium is a reference but additionally pertaining to the subject that you are teaching pertaining to what students are expected to learn including what exams you have to give it is our responsibility as a teacher to give them a very well guided to a very well abridge version we must tell them that look these are two hundred resources which are extremely useful however you must minimally read this article read these chapters read this particular tutorial of this web so give them very specific things which they will actually be able to spend time on and learn best the trick therefore is not only identifying all available open educational resources and make those available to the students but the trick is to give them a guidance that in a specified time period of a semester when they are studying one particular course with you or that course to learn minimally what is required to master the concepts of that particular course if they study these days theirs and theirs then they will be able to master the particular techniques and concepts that i think its a greater responsibility only those of you who have seen the plethora of references that you get or open educational resources with you search you will understand the significance and importance of working through a preparation of such a guided tour that remains our response so that is one aspect of open educational resource that i wanted to stress the other aspect is creating open educational resource hours so let me step back and say forget whether the resources open or not any resource that helps learning which created by teachers traditionally how did we create such a resource well we wrote notes psycho style the xerox them and circulated or we wrote explanatory points examples and so on essentially are we wrote books some of us have written books essentially the way teachers contributed maximally to the knowledge content was by writing so text writing printing cyclo styling xeroxing was the only mechanism for us to create meaningful please note that the modern technology permits us to create content in completely different form which is multimedia i can create a video clip i can create merely a sound you might have heard of the spoken tutorials project which proceed kernan mughal a runs all the spoken to dresser techniques tutorials they are of course some slides but mostly it is spoken words in the old times there was no technology which could easily permit people to create such woken or visual material add permit large number of people to access such content very easily it is now possible to do so but do we do that to the diff amongst the billions of teachers who are there in this world majority of them still write text still create using technology did a fine still circulate notes why not just because they believe students find it easier to read them but because they themselves find it easier to create afterall that is what they have done all their lives i think as teachers we must change ourselves so the form of content that we create has changed substantially and will continue to change in the coming years please note but in twenty years time when the youngest children in the world we start adapting to internet technology who knows after twenty years they may scoff at reading texts they might peru some text which is in the digital form but they would prefer the knowledge bites in terms of sound in terms of visuals it of course aided by the written cant consequently we must understand at the open educational resource that we create must be in a multi media form second it is our responsibility to create such content not only because it is parked when exercise without completing which you will not get a certificate from this workshop it is barely a mechanism to help you understand how best to create a toy but you must additionally and continuously create such small digital assets for the benefit of your students whenever you teach a course i would like you to take a bow your what i told about three thousand teachers i want each one of you to make a commitment to yourself the commitment made to me commitment between each one commitment is simp whenever you teach a course in future next semester starting from julie subsequent semesters in every course in every course you will create at least two open educational resources they could be just a webpage right up there could be just a two minute video clip there could be an audio tutorial you decide what you want but you create that and release it under let me tell you it will be a great service not only to your students but to the entire london learning community of the country and of the world in fact so please dont limit the creation of ohio to be an activity of this workshop hello i know you will all do it because as i said you will get a nice city approved certificate we just some brownie points and lag but more important than that like all good things we learn we learn them to practice into use so i would like you to make a commitment to yourself that each one of you no matter which course to teach every semester a course which will teach you will create and contribute at least a couple of open educational resources for the benefit of your students and for the benefit of all i will mention one more point about who you are and then i will go to the concluding point and that point is about the ability of people to search easily a useful content that has been created by i think had stated this earlier and the last i city workshop pepe loaded puzzle that when you search the web by any google or any other search engine you will get one lag answers all of us invariably look only at the first page and whatever is displayed the first page of the search results we tend to think that theyre the maximally useful that is not to take wikipedia wikipedia permits you to do a better search by defining multiple phrases or multiple keywords so that you can pin point not hundreds but two three five meaningful articles how is that possible that is possible because whenever somebody creates an article in wikipedia they would create these tag words and these tag words will permit search engines to specifically drill down to the most relevant please note therefore that when you create an we are counted lets you create a video clip a five minutes and it explores lets say i am a mathematics professor and i want to teach some very basic things to mice students i have discovered that people find it difficult to prove a set numbers like rootwork erastes very simple proof its a very elegant proof but many stones mess now i have studied that would have seen multiple explanations i believe that my explanation would be very good i could create just a three minute video clip mostly it is audio mostly sub gestures add some writing and these three minute video clip is created which explained the students as to how to prove route to the rest done ill give it a filename maybe debbie phatak video what dot a before that i am i we submit that and i will put it in my muddled or whatever but please realize that this name alone does not characterize everything that is stated in that five minute video clip should we not associate at least the following tags with that a number one mathematics number two arab rule number three irrational number number four debbie fortin number five i te bombay number sex may two thousand in number seven etc writes a tragic what are we doing were actually creating meaningful meta data to be associated with the digital as believe me this happens everywhere in the world although we are concerned with academic voyour but let me give an example from real lie there are people senior executives who receive thousands upon thousands of emails sometimes an email comes which is actually important but it is said by someone whose name i forget that subject line does not contain exactly what that subject is about and how many times we spent how much time we spend in just trying to go through thousands and thousands about in asking why and that is because we dont correct raised the subject line specifically if we wrote adequate number of phrases and keywords in that subject line everybody would be able to understand and everybody would be able to see a tag like the tag phrases that i mentioned are essentially the same thing which will help not only you but anybody else in the world to very quickly search a meaningful identified vac digital asset that you have so i would like to conclude this part by static numberwhat create we are for each of your courses and number two do not create and submit a dwi or upload it on moodle unless you have created an appropriate meta data which will help them to search that it is not only for them for example you know i mentioned it last time the deity bombay is creating we have built a cloud for the national virtual library of india and its pre petabyte active storage cloud and will be releasing our we are repository why end of me we would insist that anybody who submits a digital asset to be included in the open educational resource repository must give adequate number of tags in metadata form others will not expect except that the we are even though it might be of high quality i guess we believe that with millions of learners across the country at the world access our rcia repository there must be able to pinpoint their sir very quickly and very correct and that will not be possible unless theyre adequately treat please understand that you submitting and we are and then somebody is creating that meta data just doesnt we were after all the person who can maximally accurately create the metadata is the person who created the digital assets in the first place person who wrote that word document can create appropriate tag the person who created a video can create appropriate it is you so please note your responsibility does not end when you create a beautiful video explaining some concept like how rude to easy trust me it ends only when you have created adequate number of tag and these tags along with the digital asset file then forms a complete the last point i would like to make ease let me first of all recall the points because i was being continuously and therefore you might forget and i do not know how many of you are maintaining a notebook where you take notes whenever i listen to a video lecture by the way i still have my old habit of taking a note when writing not so much because i would refer to it but the act of writing actually forces the content to go into our minds easy anyway let me just recall the three or four things which are mention number one technology is important but it is only useful if it has an associated padova so this workshop emphasizes pedagogy and we expect you to understand this pedagogy at adapted whenever you teach in future the a teaching learning processes of modern technology for the benefit of number to make collaboration as the maxim of your life collaborate with your colleagues to begin with and create collaborative environment when you teach your students through discussions through problem solving etc the days when people give lectures for one hour pass nobody has patience to listen the one hour lecture please remember when we were roots we also did the patience to listen to one hour lecture continuously although we stayed there while attendance was compulsory incidentally largest number of students attend classes even today because attendance is compulsory you make the attendance non compulsory and then see the fun but i digress important thing is enhanced collaboration among jews the third point is open educational resource should be our maximal contribution not only to our students but was to remember all the pro is the dimension and were on the creation and dissemination of such we are a digital asset that the last thing that i would like to state is that you might know or you might not know apart from the educational courses on which were been conducting every piece of late weve been concentrating of the everyday before i use of high city in education and this pedagogy but you know earlier we have conducted courses on databases on analog electronics our colleague from mighty correct arenas weve conducted some twentyfive have such workshops we also run books and we want people to adopt the books the books and the blended books is something that needs to be used by all of us very extensive you may use any books you may use open source books you may use books from mighty warmed in this context some of you may know that we have launched a special program called election program under which we run something like college to corporate finishing school kind of seo courses such as soft skills courses such as workplace communication courses such as financial literacy subjects which are extremely important in health professions and the like but are hardly discussed extensively while theyre studying in the colleges we have found over the years all almost all the corporate friends tell me sir your stools are brilliant again wake later draftnik obla their contracts they cant write proper email they dont have behavioral knowledge of simple cut sees this headpiece does there are many such courses just started but ighty bombay has been running these courses for the benefit of students and we want to emphatically run them in the blend modes what it means is that this food is from a college will attend the ave you sessions online but will also have such interactive session what we would like to happen that in each color there at least one teacher who is a coordinator and that coordinator actually warm monitors how these tools are doing guides them supervises them these holders can wish the course and therefore it is quite possible that the institution may not pay attention but my experience tells me differently almost all institutions understand that these courses are at least as important as the conventional educational courses if not more important and therefore many of these colleges on their own have appointed coordinators of their own i remember having gone to a management college in lucknow last year and raven i ask them their large number of students and i ask the web management whether they appointed a coordinator he smiled and said sir you are seeing free of them sitting there and two more were busy elsewhere are not here i said what you mean five coordinator he said sir we have student from five different brunches since they operate in different parts of the building throughout the day we decided when we called for volunteers from each of the disciples and there are five of them and they all enjoyed i think that was an exceptional diligence by that institution i forget the name of that talent now management school but i compliment them and i would like to think that all colleges in the country should use this opportunity to benefit their students by offering a blended book rather than a plain online please remember the advantage of blended move it is not just interaction that the teacher will have the students but the student support i am a student in your college i will feel more responsible and accountable not just in order to give my online exam but there is a teacher called jackie will ask me every week last week cacnea did you do this group assignment and therefore i feel i bore on table and therefore i learn more now i would like majority of you were doing this pedagogy course to offer yourselves to your own college and say that you would be willing to become a coordinate so that the students are helped to learn not just their academic content which are covered by the university syllabus but something which we all believe are important skills that is why we call them scheme you know we run four types of books the ag moves which are educational books are educational courses the teacher moves which are these a web of books like environment that we create workshops in the third is skillbooks where we teach them skills the fourth work which were contemplating and will be creating soon called life what is a life who you know our students and they pass out they become professionals and their work at various levels their life becomes completely occupied by their workforce require but would they not like to retain themselves would they not like to keep themselves abreast with whatever is happening unfortunately most of them do not have time the duo to a semester long or a two semester long course they cannot afford to do that theyre busy with other things we are therefore contemplating preparation of small modules packages we call them microchiped so for example people wish to know some basics about machine land they wont become an expert in machine they buy it if they get interested they might learn more do we have a course which is just eight hour course eight hours youre a professional abuse has professional of course but you are a professional you would like to learn something about machine what if i am a civil engineer and i would like to understand art machine learning is would i not have a forever introduction which is devoid of all terminology and bombastic words at zone but tells me very simply look this what is machine who knows as a civil engineer i might get interested in future and i might actually become an extremely competent i profession after all such changes will happen but i digress the point is such life books need to be created and we would be creating all of these in collaborative form in coming years as some of you may know i have retired from my formal position as professor but you see iety bombay does not leave me alone and i dont want to leave haiti bombay were married for life rabbi has to continue being associated an over the next ten years i proposed to contribute to lifebook skillbooks anna third issue books which is for school education will i believe that school education will benefit tremendously in the coming decades from the effective use of techno so thats all i wanted to say i will only add that please use this mechanism of synchronous interaction only in india we have this feature only artibonite ravine running this a what we call blended moves nowhere else in the world have been able to use it at this scale we can reach up to ten thousands a teachers at a tie we can also reach up to twenty thousands rooms at a time my colleagues i work my surgeon dikshit and as suzanne and their team have created more than five hundred remote said my advice to them is to create thousand remote centers so that not much majority of them should be able to interact with us but they should be able to interact with each other as well there is a tremendous advantage is synchronous interaction and there is a tremendous advantage in online activity when you combine these two you get you can get the best of both voice is what were trying to do and consequently will conclude this rather longish dress to you by same apart from doing all other things please try to ensure that you maximize the synchronous interaction with your students with garlic teachers with us by participating in such interactive say thank you so much overhead sorry i am handing over to jackie i iced over in out wrongly over but not out of date thank you pros of attack are soil i hope all of you understood the importance of thesa synchronous interactions and what we are trying to do with this a baby i see it is important that you all the skills that you have obtained as prozac fatigue set in the courses like the ones offered in lakshya many of the skills that have learned like a creation of web sites screen casts a moodle courses all these could be a useful a useful tool to ensure that students participate effectively in those courses and they get the best benefit out of it and we do have online lectures are online videos that are uploaded from ati bombay but the effectiveness of this will increase if you do in class or module in college activities using those are resources having said that let me now move to the next session are in the session ill be detailing about the peer review a activity are se one zero one of which are many of you had doubt so ill be explaining what the arkive won the rationale of ars a zero one and ill also be explaining to you we are a l be also explaining to you the lab activity that will have to do today afternoon followed by the breakout session activity that you will have to do tomorrow are to ensure that a a the synchronous interactions are taken to the next level of effective interaction so ah this is about the peer review activity in na are zero won many of you had a doubt about what this activity is all about for them or let me repeat what the question of are the zero won was so the question that we have asked is in not more than two hundred and fifty words explain how i sit is bringing in changes within your teaching learning so many of you at the start of the eff deep itself have a indicated how you are using technology inside your class this technology so it need not be technology that you were familiarized enough but it could be technology that you were exposed to even before or even before they left and all of you would agree that there could there is a minor improvement or a minor change that you would see in the classrooms when you are integrating technology so op this is like a short essay questions for us to understand what is your view about technology how do you look at your classrooms are how do you look at changes in your classrooms for example a from arci one one three one we had a faculty who shared their experience about conducting a particular strategy so other faculty had done a pre test then did a strategy followed by a post test and looking at changes in between soap we want all teachers to generate these kind of reflective actions about their own practice in theory it is called reflection on practice and it is found to be very beneficial in any of the profession in any of the professions and more importantly in teaching profession when you reflect on what you have done you will understand where you can improve what all did what all worked well what all did not work well and then make suitable improvements in the next part of the arm a next offering or the next successive activity that you do a do a for example in the teaching learning scenario does the same classroom when you integrate one technology in the next class menu use the same technology will learn from the pitfalls and you will learn from the advantages and use these technologies effectively and it is a continuing process so we learned a lot from use of these technologies and we try to as a teacher we always try to improve ourselves and for that practice is required and on top of practice reflection on practice is required this exercise is meant as an aid towards eliciting reflective practice from and we have asked you a the three important hints that we provided along with the question is how you can frame the answer so while answering please ensure that you provide clear examples of how you have used i sit in your teaching learning are the writing has your reflection on the changes that you have absorbed and you provide a minimum of one instance of student reaction or student feedback on the use of icity so these are the three main elements that we are looking from this are in while you are answering now to see an example submission we have updated that in the course submission window right now or ill just go to the application right now okay so what you have here is the course if dtype two zero one and changed to student mode and in the big two graded activities right below the rubric so this is the rubric item through which evaluations will be done but right below the rubric you can see an example of a submission so this is a from a past a hydration of the app so you can see that the teacher has said that i city has been proven to be a game changer for teachers like me evidence of usage that they are telling is i extensively use powerpoint for some purpose pedias interactive simulations facebook and whatsapp arm so these other technologies that the teacher uses inside the classroom a look at what they have said for student feedback students enjoy these resources and are very much excited when they use simulations one student has explicitly written a facebook post of how simulations help in clarifying the concepts that are he learned this was widely shared by his friends from other colleges so here what we mean by evidence of usage is something that you have absorbed as evidence of usage or change within your classroom and explaining that you need not do actual classroom are right now to post this evidence it is from your own experience of how your students have shared or how students a how yours wouldnt have said that up how use of these technologies were found i want to be beneficial for them or some important class actions in the classroom that show evidence of student engagement or student loan so this is what is meant by student feedback so but the most important thing about this answer is your own reflection so in terms of reflection on usage what the teacher has said it does i see that i city has increased access and efficiency of teaching learning process in my class hour i do see the following drawbacks as an instructor i need to spend more time with use of social media we have to be extra careful about data privacy students seem to be more including social media gratification and do not focus on actual learning behind the activity i will have to now focus on ensuring that students do not go by instant fame rather rely on deep load now this are words of teacher who have done something with the technology and is learning from the entire experience and this is what we mean by reflection on usage do not worry if you have already submitted the answer that is always se we all learn from different diverse views so this is one example view that we have shown over here they could be different other ways in which several teachers write the answer but what is important is that what is important is that you focus on these three aspects while writing your answer it is like a short essay where you need to articulate your thoughts you have you some technology inside the classroom what was your experience it may be good or bad but what changes did you see it may be positive it may be negative but it is what is important is are you reflecting on this positive and negative experiences and trying to do something more that is what we intend from this particular exercise so ah the example submission is available in the iety bombays a course itself now we have added below the rubric so description of the rubric a if you have any queries are on the are zero one please post them as a questions in the tab or if somebody has already posted a question similar to yours please upvote it so that we can address it from the a a view a tab ill be explaining that towards the end of this interaction helps take time to look at the question and answer your answer the that particular quest now what is important is the aview interactions that your going to do today and tomorrow today as you all know you will do a local activity and to morrow what your going to do is you do a breakout session where you will continue to do a thus a interact with other horses and get reflection and feedback on the activities that you have planned local so up the lab and breakout activities the scenario is that all of you have gone through the basics of good but muddle we you have usually few elements as of now there are other modules that you can use for higher order are activities like glossary database wiki lesson workshop and course completion and restrict access settings what you have to do today is have a look at these activities we have assigned groups for each of you the groups are famous the groups that you are came across in the last every interaction we will or re show the groups toward the end of this a presentation but groups one in groups of two basically or in any group you have not more than ten are sees so all our seas in a group have to focus on one particular activity and as a local activity today what you have to do localize identify how these activities are can be used in moodle an prepare small moodle course as a nazi which contains resources and activities that explain your allotted moodle activity up when you put these resources these resources should target the recall understand and apply levels in blooms taxonomy and the activities should be doable in thirty minutes so you will have to create a moodle course which is accessible by others are the moodle resources should clearly explain what each of these resources are the allotted resource how you can create it create an activity using it what is the purpose so it should help them in understand recalling understanding and applying arm these are activities in their own courses and the activities should be doable in thirty minutes what you have to do tomorrow is present the moodle course that you created to your group that means as an individual are present the content of the course to all other are sees within your group while one r sees presenting others have to identify whether activities are at appropriate level so it may not be that you have a activity still appliance that is fine at least to recall and understands what your going to great design out of class segment of flip classroom activity and what you also have to check is whether the activities are doable in thirty minutes so once all ten are all a present members within a group a once they complete the presentation together you will have to identify the best resources from the groups that your scene and refine your outputs okay so what you will do is you will create a moodle course today pour explaining one particular model activity it will be targeting recall understand or apply levels in blooms taxonomy once you have done developing the course today tomorrow you will have to present this course to your other group members who may who will also have worked on the same a a item and you will get feedback from your colleagues as to how appropriate these resources were to target maybe learning levels and also the duration of the activities whether it is doable in thirty minutes but all things you need to do are to improve the activity and at the end of the presentation all the presentations you will be able to refine your course and are a youll be able to refine your course and create a more structured course that other students can access okay i will tell you why this courses required this course what we are going to do his will make other aa sees a do these activities in the next interaction session and across before the next interaction session will have encouraged participants from other horses to enroll in this course and take this course to learn about these content and what you can do is add then in the next interaction session that is on twenty sixth and twenty seven you will then look at designing in class activities for the same content through which they will be able to you will be able to engage other people in a session and make them better understand what each activities for kids so that is the broad aim of this ah activity ah i see that there are lot of hand races from different centres or if a waddell docile do a floor transfer at this moment two eggs a four clarifying any doubts regarding the lab activity for today ah what a lucile reset all the undies right now so you can do a hand race now to ask specific questions regarding lab activity so if you do not if you didnt get sufficient clarity of the lab activity please feel free to ask the question right now okay so ill be available a here across a a the next hour or so to clarify all your doubts or if you have understood the activity then you can please go ahead and start thinking about creating this activity are four at your own arse okay so this are seeing one pre dubplate ribbon good morning mickey regarding this it would be where it needed youtube my eleven year we are happy with her lead in brit number nineteen eleven appear on the workshop fittingly yes yes so the groups have been allotted so all of you would know your group member or numbers so the question is whether they have to do only one activity yes the answer is yes you will have to focus only on one activity and what we are expecting by the end of the entire exercises that will have consolidated courses created by all our fees which explain the different important components of muddle and you can learn from each other oh yeah lets move to the nexts a horsey horsey one zero four two one zero one to judge rie sony college nagpur are your voices not year round and in his own lab so what is not clear can you can you explain a little more can you articulate what is not clear in the activity you will meet please okay clearly now and move one could match his well okay so lovely and the ethical eternalism okay so the question is people with a nazi are from different domains so how do they collaborate so this activity is transcending disciplines what you are asked to do is explore one particular activity in moodle so each of your group is given so what does your group which group were you part of in the last interaction map archive only okay for ra group too what you have to do is up you will have to look at a lady i activity called glossary a moodle you can create lot of activities okay and glossary is one such activity so you will have to understand what glossary is how it is used in model how somebody can utilize glossary activity in their own course this is what you will have to understand in the next three hours and you should then consolidate your understanding and create a course through which other faculty do not know about glossary can actually look and understand what glossary i a the item called glossary is about and how they can use in their own course so this is the purpose of this activity an you don not need to be a oduce a you can be from any domain what we are asking you is to explore this activity would soothe the moodle activity called glossary when you actually go to moodle course you can see this activity in the heart when you click on add resource or activity you can see this glossary activity there are lot of helpful resources available in the model document there are lot of web resources available on what this activity is about a you should use that to learn what these activities and teach it to others that is the aim of this activity are you clear right now i am so and try to think of this as a flipped classroom a you are going to do this in flip classroom mode where you will create a moodle course only for out of class activity so all your learners will do this online and all your colleague teachers will do this online so they will need to first understand what this activities and then you will do an inclass activity to explain how you understood this particular a moodle module a in the next week so will have learners for you where you can get the specific feedback from leaders as well okay yeah this center one one six to a sheer pacific institute of information technology haryana and group is vietnam oh okay and we are going to work up on the database activity yes so we have to work individually on this activity and we have to create a moodle course over it now so you will have to work as a laugh together say this is not an individual activity so this is a group activity within the archive so you will have to allot tasks through each one held them together come to an understanding of what this database activity is an ass an artsy youll create a moodle course beyond how be what we have understood about this activity so that we can teach somebody yes so in support of that we have to prepare the presentation or some other material that we have to make available for out of life activity yes we need to upload the seaming on moodle yes oh and yeah so treat this as a course which you are teaching your colleague teachers maybe in your own college or from other colleges right now in this particular episode they may not know about this database activity model for how will you teach them to effectively utilize database activity that is what the hold purposes okay goopy and kitchen are all participants please note this is not an individual activity this is a artsy group activity so a the course coordinator we request the course coordinators to engage all artsy participants in this particular activity because you need you need to learn about this entire a the new model activity within your artsy first so that you can teach somebody else okay yeah the sauce are se one four two to a a i as a ms institute of technology pune maharashtra hello hello hello sara europeans and the zimbabwean arsenal i already did discourse during the november two thousand seventy year have done all the activities and so i have submitted two years but due to some problem i dont know what was the problem but will you display the list in at least my name was not there therefore i have again in rule to the schools okay yeah so can you help me about this problem okay so if you have already done up dippy one and two last year nude a barb for what is the problem you have your problem is that venue a displayed the list that is eligible student to provide a certificate my lung was not there in that list it may be because your total score may not have actually gone above the required grading a criteria your score sixty two percent total score and you had submitted the wire but due to some reason i was unable to go to the center and i was not included in any group so i have individually submitted that we are also that that would be the problem say abu sessions in a if depth is very critical and new will have to do the activity as a group that is what we would always we have always told in the last in all all hour of deepest app though it would be arming al check with my workshop tim why your case and in wwii with sixty to person you are not eligible in the last time but if youre participating in the eff deepy too please ensure that so there will be buried different format in the abu sessions this time around even in the we are activity that you create will be a good learning experience for you as in beer going beyond our standard um what is it the formats that we have used in the previous two iterations of this app so it will be a learning experience for you but i will check with our team also as to why this has happened okay he said and kenney team the team size of this activity two to three it is the same you can have two to three people in working in the same tea infuser yeah let me now go to a another this national engineering college thoothukudi tamil nadu arcy one four three nine yes sir you are not audible i can see you raise your hand but your not audible can you check your mike can you increase the volume of your mike ah its the audio is coming but it is very low due to any user or viewer some news you will be virtually a non team members publicising okay so be sure to inspire the group for each go to the total nine dream cruise but would you mention the total known only to you all the inane groups ill make is a single topic in a single useful if you do like this okay so let me clarify so the question is regarding the groups that were displaced the groups are be all the horses were grouped into a amid all the different archives were grouped into eleven groups during the last interaction so that this group what i did for ra abu lab activities that grew so last time which which team did you up you have your with a group of others is right for breakout session do you remember which group it was okay i display the groups because we have the group we are the future your local group along with yeah okay so are dronacharya college so i believe there are group number nine or eleven i forgot which group they are but so what you have to do is each group has been allotted one actively okay there are six components or five to six components of a model that all horses have to explore and in this activity we are asking each addressee to explore only one component so as a nazi together you will have to arm you will have to explore one component which is allotted to your group or let me see whether i can have the list of a groups in our raw already so i will show you the groups once again this was in nef deep e groups again at the end of this interaction i show the groups once again i show the groups once again but i do is what you have to focus is on only on one particular activity and the two as a entire horsey so all are seas will work so it is you do not need to create a nine courses or fifteen nineteen courses together all of you should create so you should create one course or from one login id a ideally the course coordinator to create this on a generic email id which everybody can access and you should upload to youtube as a group activity you should collect materials from different one deliberate on which are the appropriate resources if you want to create new slides you should create a now you should explore what this moodle activities all about and then create a thirty minute equivalent worth activity so by thirty minutes it could be that they can access some resources for lets say five minutes to ten minutes they will be reading this particular resource then there may be doing a small quiz activity there may be a three minute video explaining what the muddled up activities all about you could find this from web ensure that there are licenses are appropriate and use this inside your moodle course okay so this is what as a nazi you are going to do today and for this you need help of knot up more than one person so when you have nineteen people nazi what we expect is that you will delegate the tasks to each and every one of your army members are somebody will explore somebody will create slides and then took together put together a single moodle course okay put together a single moodle course are that anybody can access and it is accessible within thirty minutes all year to ensure is that you are only providing information transmission in through this moodle course right now okay so you should target recall understand or apply levels in blooms taxonomy while creating this course are you clear year emerson so you not audible flip was marty who visit adamson yes a moodle is using for flipped classroom activity or you will youll come to know presumably away seem a moodle is a learning management resource and when you are providing these resources uploading these resources in moodle there are certain activities in moodle which you can use for both in class and out of class activities okay so you have seen a digital blooms taxonomy in week one so you can see that moodle activities can be used across multiple levels and this is what is a what is happening what is required or maybe both in class and out of class i suppose you want to travel smith some information you can upload this information as media files pippity files upload using the file or folder you can upload even videos admins embed videos into a moodle course you can also create quizzes activities to check their information trends whether they have the learners have got the appropriate information and you can use all these activities that are listed right now to ensure that learners create content they evaluate their analyze and create new content in the moodle course so you will see is it possible to please wait one more question please wait is it possible to go at that level yes the classroom the flipped classroom absolutely absolutely it avin you need practice but once you have sufficient practice you can go up to that level it is how you design the activity that it really matters and this particular ftp is geared towards helping you to move towards those levels and many of these activities you are creating content it is not just information transmission now you will be creating content in the safety you will be trying to teach somebody else so why cant you so why cant your students do a simple activity like this when they learned content create something so that they can teach their friends booth yeah please wait personally select the topic hustle you will use the topic was four seeds topping her noodle creation a re blanks te the to greedy use according to one group member nine yes youre supposed to do it attitude creation no your not supposedly silicom okay see your not supposed to create workshop activity you have to first learn what workshop activity is and teach others what workshop activities above so you will have to do a what is a course creation too should your course will be about how to create and use workshop activity in mood which is no need to do any hoosier budget creation bruno yes no need to do that particular activity today but you need to tell others or tell other faculty colleagues what this activity is all about how it could be used all those things you need to tell from by creating a course within your group yes within your group so malt leads us all teachers all participants within your arci has together identify appropriate resources that could be used for teaching learning of workshop module okay good a person a this arcy one four zero eight malibu institute morning good morning hiking yavaughnie yes im a clean yes hype i a few questions of how many participants been a group okay as per the demand wise means which we are going to summit on honor before twenty photo me okay my second question is if more participant in a particular domain or a nazi then how to break down or say the audis yeah okay third question is what should i do for outstation seventy three participants which you have been allotted newly then i have to put their attendance or upon the group group okay so all workstation is okay but question is moreover tannaim as archie yet pleasant the are secreted muddle or participant created wood oak ah okay so there are four questions let me clarify so i believe there is a white disconnect about oh yeah activity and group activities supposed to be done at yars okay the where activity is a course project activity that has to be done toward the end of the course of that a separate and team formation is a separate thing altogether so are within your r see participants have to identify people whom with whom they can work with and all these participants have to inform the team to the course coordinator who in turn will inform the entire team structure from that are ce too ah i d bombay okay no we are having a seven people from a electronics and communication to mid career oh how we can create the group either you can break it out for three or four poor poor people in the group other famous okay so you can you can bring them down into groups of two to three hours and each see it as it is up see the groping for various participants specific gay are seed need not do anything so participants can find out friends or colleagues with whom they can work on particular topic so they all come discuss among each other what topic they can work hard and together they form groups of two to three so if you have seventeen participants you may have like nine to ten groups of varying sizes two three two two etc or do not go to pfa member groups if you have such large number of participants try to make sure that see the idea of the safety is that each faculty should be able to practice and when the group sizes small like two to three then only theyll be able to practice the different aspects of open educational resource creation as well as report writing okay so that is why the group number size is given as two and three are regarding the attendance are a with the new participants please provide the same it is the same process itself so you have new participants for the sap dippy so are their attendance and upload in the interface that is provided for attendance uploading the thing is a wretched me even with the outside but egypt they did not contact me will go at morning every day i talked to them over one year and someone said they did not get in the mail that had there been a doll to guide you on it so now the problem with me is that scientific participant even i dont know anyone and you are having in archaic won it and feel at ease now so i will i be able to create that the group accordingly the domain but how i can create the group the out of seventy three as because i dont know them and would get in contact with me oh cant so this is the problem here i i completely adore yazoo i completely understand seo for a course coordinator or remote center coordinators were facing the issue that outstation participants have not contacted you sebi onus is on the participants that they create the team and intimate you unladen and oh yeah and a acti a where activity is a mandatory activity and that is required for giving or getting a certificate so if the outstations they were all participants of the previous app if they were and they were enrolled and they were given the brochure about the art are the details were provided by the workshop team from here the onus is on them to whether to participate in this epk or not so a deal be sending out a communication to them to contact course coordinator you know what the processes they should also be familiar with the we are process otherwise instructions will be uploaded in the anti bombacks course about we are activity or they will have to form the team so they will have to discuss with each other and form a team and intimate so if good they didnt know so it is the onus is on the participants to intimates outstation participants to intimate the course coordinator or the appropriate messages will be provided to them through email and also will be uploaded in the iati bombacks course as soon as the third week starts okay so im digital musician oking ema are one model regarding the negativity yes so as a nazi so currently what your to do what is your group number of horror in the last breakout session which group your in i can remember i am i forgot it yamato please if you so in sum the groupm yazoo isle i upload the group a the sheet with the group number right now but you will be so you are allotted a particular activity that you as a nazi has to explore and together as a nazi all participants should help in creating a moodle course which explains what that activities and how it is useful a while they are creating a corso this courses created specifically for teachers like epdp participants are in the current app dippy who may not be aware of these activities in mood so this course should help them in a transferring information about that particular module that is allotted to you how it could be used maybe you can give the example you can give the media about how to set up this activity you can do a lot of things but all this thing should be limited to thirty minutes of out of class time okay we were quickly people group number in there im given yes yes yes so a soybean so will communicate to the course coordinator are in what format they have to submit the team a team details to us okay thank you ah let me now go to the next or see archive one trade seven daphne yeah okay so there are so there are no submissions required for the group activity that has been given a given to the lab activity requires all of you to create that moodle course are locally and the odd discussed that tomorrow with the other group members who may also have created a similar course okay so since all of you are involved in the same activity you will learn from each other about the importance of this why this is useful or how this course materials you have created so that you will be able to ask see through discussion that is what the aim of this activity there are no submissions per say of this particular a lab activity right now the submissions whatever we have talked about is we are activity we are activities the course project activity that is separate okay do not confuse the we are activity with the lab activity that you have to do today or what theyll do is so if people are still confused a in the afteroon also

sea you will have to grill a discuss with each other and learn one new module or one new model activity and teach it to others so youll have to create resources for doing this that is all this activity is about a any more questions yeah ah let me now go to one four five six karpagam institute of technology reference rabbenu belonging to a or even obese its okay i have a very honorable activity yeah the moodle cloud login a bar we have to find the atoms youre given glossary lesson our workshops for you to find its okay are two important things click on add an activity or resource

have been created then only the learning will come up with that we can add presentations ah yes an activity oriented yes yesterday and it be within thirty minutes yes so see this is a two part activity so in this particular week as a nazi you will be creating the out of class segment for that particular activity okay consider this as a flipped classroom a scenario where you will be allotted some participants and they will have to go through or the content first to understand what this activity is about in the next breakout or abu session you will make a you will have them you will design an activity through which they can better understand how to use these activities in their own courses so in the first part you are doing the information transmission about or that particular module lets a wiki wiki how to use wiki model that information transmission you are doing through this activity it licking what we have prepared a year so mom can you tell me what course are you teaching in your own course in your own college right now ill be able to better help you a in terms of analogy what course are you teaching in your code a college i am teaching circuit an ally okay your teaching circuit analysis and so you are familiar with nortons theorem right yet if so consider this exercise as in you are giving them explanation and practice about nortons theorem outside the classroom so your moodle course is only giving them information about what is not an theorem whereas northern theorem used or how can you actually use nortons theorem is a simple circuit analysis so this is the basic information that you need to provide to make them do activities right similarly you will have to do with the appropriate a the moodle activity that has been assigned to you so your teaching them muddle through mood okay yeah yeah okay let me now a one second to all our team members are the group leaders of the a the teams so there were ten a group leaders that we had identified a please do

listening yes please wait no yes please wear your hair in small non renewal or severe having nine members among them supposedly regarding a sadhu been weakened or group okay in this weekend she defend surged we can take a general topics this is for the ohio activity right after making an activity no voyager maui hub so that you have to do as a singular see do not group so do not get confused between we are activity and the lab activity today in the terms group appear in both of them please do not get confused maybe we are grouping has to happen locally within the ar see that you can submit the team size by a team details by twenty fourth of this month they will do a course project activity based on which the model creation that is that is different and current model creation activity all of you have to do as a single office you are one single team whether it is nion whether it is ninety or whether it is a year three you will have to do a single activity together do not do not split do not do any grouping for the lab activity that is meant for today after today at noon earn your business with our goodness kiwiblog seven yes so we want to discuss future yes you will have to discuss when leone after discussion when we want to activity tomorrow or ruining itself so you will have to create the moodle course today itself you will have to create your moodle course today itself because tomorrow you will be discussing this moodle course with other horses in your group in group seven do you have any specific hobby or we can conduct business topic so the topic has already been provided to you so you will have to sew for group seven are what is required is up you will have to look at the lesson activity in moodle and you will have to prepare a course on how to do lesson activity in mood if you have any doubts or add to a clock please join the classroom where all other horses are present a whol be doing similar activities today after okay you can get clarification from other horses as well yeah okay so next us arcy one one three five or perry or mani malai universitynew york allow low loosen any miami yes i can please god i love yes as we what we have understood now is we are in group theory and we suppose that we have to create a course on database yes i know where our queries when we are distributing the work between ourselves yes we have a group like for example six or seven year o are we supposed to distributor to each and every room is it that way yes so all your art so i can see more than six or seven people in your artsy all people should do contribute to whatever course you are great and though what is that we have to protect in tomorrow or is it like we have to protect only the database thing by the anti coordinator yes so the coordinater has done so to be other groups in your suit to the other half is in your group you will have to show your moodle course what you have considered for your moodle course which resource you have taken a job or why you have selected that resource that you have to present to other arts are sees in that particular ra a a in your group and also learn from their presentations as well how you can refine that particular course okay another doubt irsay did thirty minutes yeah oh thirty minutes is the total duration of the information transmission and assimilation everything no it is only for information transmission the whatever content you put up in the course it should be accessible to the learner within thirty minutes so if you gave a one hour video that may not be s that may not suit your purpose right as a learner so think of your own students will they actually go through even thirty minutes of content outside the new year so that is what we are actually trying to compress your raw information transmission to thirty minutes so that your you can also learn how to manage the moodle course activity within that time thank you yeah okay so off they are okay let me take artsy one one three one ball chains since they are team yeah arci oneman thriven a balcon college please illusion yeah yeah merry thankful to the previous discussions that we had because more often question i mean most of the questions were answered okay do also take of the student assignment plans this particular question data what tool to include in the lesson and does so as to me hit a two minute duration since we are in group it be hauling group it so vital to include soon to make the duration of the lesson he mill you can include any law any resource it could be pedia it could be videos see all see are when you create a property you know the approximate time required to go through the pity rigt solicits a ten slide pippity typically you may take a close two five five to six minutes to go through the content of the pipe it similarly if it is a three minute video you may take three to four minutes to actually process the content of the video if your doing a quiz all its a three questions you may need up approximately five to six minutes to do the entire quiz so you will have to judge what resource how much time based on the link duration and the feature that you have added in the resource so if your put up fifty slides then obviously the student is going to take more than thirty minutes to completely process whatever theyre in the fifty slides right it is one more question should we upload do you lie of the moodle a course on an wordpress are suicide so that it will be accessible to the staunton yes you can do that i was about to suggest this today tomorrow afternoon to upload all this are in the op archive wordpress website but yeah you can go ahead and add that in the archive wordpress website that you created for if the pivot and also want to be the username and password for the muddled i supposed to summon a soe currently create test students appear trying to see whether we can include the others are other students other aa sees into your course

aspects you can clarify it or i would request all the teacher or cease to stay back for ten minutes so that i can come to each one of you and check whether you have understood it or not because you you may need to explain this to the other group members within your ra are within your group other awci members within your group and to aid in it go to the saints won two elections there is a okay a looks like few of me or sees are not active what will do is wheel alot a another alternate or seizure a teacher or seen that particular one please give us some time will communicate that to you on next is a archive one zero one to judge rie sony college are you have understood what has to be done in a lab activity right yeah but how will you can choose a you can either choose to use slides or you can actually show the model codes to be others that is up you can also link holy yes absolutely no humanities yes okay please take time to explain this to be other horses in your group okay if they are just clarify so from to a club today till five thirty others other arthis all the hours you can access the group classroom so you can communicate with them using debut whether raddy

whatever information you want to give okay so let me now go to ask one zero five eight one zero five eight go engineering college allow a hello and have you understood the activity over their afternoons yes so youll be able to explain we are clear on the act so youll be able to explain to the other group members in your raw in your ra group right yes okay a grid or any other clarifications are do let me you can ping ino shoes okay will be oil bigger yes thank you thank you sir let me now go to the next or see or see one zero nine six marathwada institute ahmedabad alabam archive won

gave time for each are free to present you need to allot time and tell others at what time each of you need to present etc you need to set up and ensure that although things are done okay one doubt is that whether all participant has to explain something or any one presenter will be any one or two presenters can explain the activity but ensure that all participants engage in the activity to create that resource okay okay yeah a this or see one month zeroid from group seeks a unfortunately there are no errors or see one year one month zero it emerging yes definition yes have you understood the

so you enter you will observe you will have to learn how wiki activity is done in model and teach this to others okay okay and you will have to happen all the members within the arci has to be engaged in creating a moodle course to teach others how becky activities done in nazi the time limit of all the activities have been all the activities within the moodle core should be accessible within
