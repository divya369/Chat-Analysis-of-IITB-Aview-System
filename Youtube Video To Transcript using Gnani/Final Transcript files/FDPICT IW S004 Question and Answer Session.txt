the learning is mostly about assimilation and application the information part just happens at some point so giving a lot of new topics is not as beneficial as taking a topic and looking at it from multiple ways and solving many problems related to it and this is something you can even keep in mind for your own ditch so will start taking questions will do a few hendrixs first and then will go out to the questions we saw in chat so the first star center is the one three five five please question about this image as a group has to be unclear as to be an action coordinator account likelier voter opinion about certain topics chunk it the rehab team record decision documents like what they have not on the decisions you have to submit all these details are there to xindian moodle account so the activities the group activities we did today morning before lunch work for you to apply your knowledge to give an opportunity that there are no submissions required from those activities our goal of asking the workshop coordinators to keep an eye was to promote this activity was to make sure that there is sufficient the interaction between the participants so you dont have to submit anything from the mornings activities but there are some lab activities that participants will do later today afternoon in the lab those will need to be submitted and the instructions for those are present robin will be given will be reiterated at the end of the session now and then also be present on wood so no submissions required from morning sent a one two four nine and a question regarding class activity ivy active learning techniques are pin sharp are a parent share how to identify a specific topic requires other flirting sharma not all the topics can be done with the tips for example are problems with the multiple solutions can be a good choice for trips because russia activity can be done at a better way long to identify which topic require repairs in maya question okay okay thank you this is an excellent question let me just repeat repeat the question briefly so that everybody is on board or the question is how do i identify topics which are suitable for doing think pair share services which topics in fact should be choosing to implement thing peshat and as you noted center want to phone and not all topics are equally suitable to do thing passion so one quick answer is that or one quick resource this is not an answer but more of a resource if you look at the guidelines for think pair share which have been uploaded that contains some there are some recommendations on how to do so even afterwards you can go look at the guidelines but in a nutshell i think this is where they are the input of multiple people multiple thinking and rethinking inputs are actually valuable so as you mention if you have a problem which rick which permits multiple solution approaches it may be a design problem or it may be many more than one way to implement a program logic or it may be multiple solution approaches towards a similar final answer or it may be a problem which actually has no single correct answer but different perspectives are all valid in such a case is in fact a good alternative for a second place where you may try it is suppose you have a problem which is sought is complex and daunting for a student to do entirely on their own what the teacher does is splitted into smaller parts but not smaller parts as in do this first then do this but the thing phase is sum is the aspect air contains the part of the problem which every student can do easily and then by the time they come to the pair they can build on the thin face and maybe it requires two people to actually crack the problem that is given in the preface so you can always structure a very highly complex problem into the three phases so that students build on the previous work previous solutions built to reach the finals so you will see similar recommendations in the guidelines for how to do tips that have been posted in fact this question is something that you should be asking whenever you see any new strategy which topic a suitable for the strategy which topic is not suitable topics which may not be suitable or objectives which may not be suitable for tips are when you have very routine step by step procedures for things that need to be memorized then tips may not be suited to an add on to this or if you look at the tips activity constructor at the end of it they were given three broad examples oners ben url you have something like multiple solutions nader is a problem solving tasks a third is a general a barrier to explore beyond the concept so these are three main areas where peoples is found to be really useful this app from our own experience center one zero nine eight place my question is regarding lead it would appear then the domain may be carried out by digital faculty member but no re energy environment is the burning topic and engineers must have a glitch on that we generally when agarwal did they go for a multi disciplinary or interdisciplinary articles question definitely driven to help you create an awareness about the snow above about the environment and energy in the relevant today ratner domain knowledge can be use to produce a product which is environment friendly and energy efficient judicial add an additional dimension the guns learning and the level of debt is that and begun that valuation creative level that ones mind can we go for the interdisciplinary type of a if a special thanks your comment is very well taken suggestion here is that if there are some issues like energy or climate change for example or the water problem which actually requires multidisciplinary perspectives to be able to solve it would that make a good tip is question and i havent personally tried it myself but i think it definitely would you can in fact in the pairs are in the shares as you can focus on these multiple perspectives so for example in the shares what he can do is try to get different pairs each coming from a different angle to say talk about their solution or their concern and actually highlight this sir is multiple perspectives so others if your teaching any topic similar to the similar or which can encompass such a problem are such a problem definitely suited yeah one more caution to add on to others see some of these topics are very sensitive so youll have to ensure that the activity the think pair share activity is more looking at the academic side of it rather than becoming a chaotic debate a bit different sides taking different views so theres not any biases you have to specifically focus on the academic angle where you look at the multiple aspects of the problem or the solution if you focused to that it will be a much more constructive tips within your class having said this evening the ethical was writing this while but here it is use of domain knowledge problem yes thats the job center one zero one five my question is regarding flip your classroom or the flipped classroom conflict will work only when all the students we look forward to the video outside the classroom the students will not watch the video outside the classroom they will not participate in the tiny side activity inside classroom activity so what is a remedy to overcome this issue so that all the students with a porch outside here videos so this question had come up even in the morning but its really important enough that its worth talking about again and the question is about slip classroom how do we ensure that all students watch the videos because students dont watch the videos then their participation in the inclus phase will be limited and so on and so forth this is definitely a valid concern and what we can do as teachers at best is to try to encourage and we will go towards ensuring that most of our students actually watch the videos so some strategies that people have used and that have worked hard to have a short in class quiz may be at the beginning that are based on the videos so this is the stick that you can provide us the students know that there will be tested maybe one marker to marquis thatll cound find semester assessment of this is one thing that people have tried it also good revision should have a quiz like this its a good revision of the video material the other thing you can try which actually encourages students rather than discourages them is to actually make the in class activities interesting as well as worthwhile for them to engage in class activities where they feel that yeah this is useful for me if not in my exam than in my project or in the interview that hell be appearing for next year or in my placement and so on so make the in class activities very relevant for them this will also pull in more students to participate in class activities and if they find that not watching the videos not helping them then youre likely to find more people watched the following time we will not vote the video so should we ignore what to do in class right okay what options do you have one is are you you ignore them or i think its worthwhile pointing out that look if you did not watch the video and cum you will have a hard time to race class dont allow them to disrupt your class because thats really not fair to the people who have already watched the videos and its also not sure if you re explain the concept just because five people in the class have not watched the video thats also not really the purpose but i think again this is something you have to try and see what works in your classroom what is usually worked for us here is that we point out we saw that look if you havent done it we wont have hard time today and then show it illustrates that actually its not a good thing for them to do it you can also send reminders here because we are dealing with various quality oat mixture so persuaded she took pity on him five per cent of the period ahead we hope to engage them in the class because we cannot ignore bay because they are having their right to right of education because they are paying a cafe so flipped classroom this concept will be applicable for literary edibles groups but for the byu students how we can manage them and we cannot repeat as per your discussion we cannot repeat the topic if i repeat the topic others will get irritated and others will lose the concentration so that is a very serious so few comments here should be having a discussion here but i think this is really two or three important points about flipped classroom offers you cannot ensure that hundred percent of the students will be engaged hundred percent of the time and the additional point i like to make here is this does not happen even in a regular leech even in our regular lectures we dont have hundred percent participation we have hundred percent bodies if your mandate at attendance but you dont have hundred per cent of attend and attentive minds so hundred percent is not something that is realistic what doing active learning aims towards and what it ensures to large extent is that a larger fraction of your students are genuinely engaged in the content and you can read a few papers which say that look we found eighty percent of the students engaged eighty percent of the time it is in fact a fantastic number compared to what happens in a regular lecture however we cannot ignore even one student so some other suggestions have some other channels of communication open keep a moodle discussion going for people who need extra help have extra office hours so you dont need to get the other students irritated but you have we have to all use multiple prongs to try to address most of the students i think as teachers as the best weekend with a kid and yet one more question from my setup i tried a tested vicki and greg this is preparing for designing very spirit okay this question a offer of the information of other participants are asked this question is about can a can somebody write some up some scripts some programming script likes essays or other things for the wiki are yes and no yes because we are model is a collaborative arm a open source development platform and the specific biggie that we are using is a developed by open university in ukase which called oh ooh wiki so yes you can write scripts you if your familiar with the git git hub or other such development platforms all these quotes of the model a source code is available in git you can directly go they find the appropriate repository of the ohio becky a no you cannot do any custom scripting in the current model because we have control of this model and there are different levels of learners among yourselves so we dont want a too much of a buddhist variations happening across the weeks so we try to keep it standard so that everyone get up a basic experience of the wiki so yes the comment is well appreciated and i hope you do such activities because there are conferences for moodle alone the learning management system moodle alone has conferences like moodle moot which happens across different parts of the world there was one in india this year this going to be another next year so i think the community is very large and everyone is looking at teachers are rather than developers coming in and joining in are these moodle mood conferences job a dish that you go ahead and do such development activities thank you a minute i will think its a couple of questions from the chat window because theyre related to the tips and flipped classroom that weve been discussing a one question yeah theres a series of questions on how to do pairing in think pair share or how to make groups and to the end a instructor intervene and so on so when it comes to group learning activities there are actually two broad categories one is where the groups are well structured for example if you have a project that has to be done for the entire semester either the instructor makes the groups forms the groups on some criterias sometimes students form groups but these are structured group activities where the same group a does the choir does the task for a certain amount of time and so on are there are other group activities which are called unstructured group activities and think pair share as well as one more a strategy called pure instruction with some of you may be familiar with come under this unstructured group activity what unstructured unstructured doesn mean chaotic here it just means that there is no specific rule for group formation so it can be something as simple as turn to your neighbor or turn back or three of you were sitting there why dont you start talking so what the instructor can do here is to decide the maximum and minimum within a group in think pair share pair face we actually say try to limited to two because we found that its actually a good number in the peer instruction or clicker technique the group size some people work with two some work with three four five occasionally ten but i would say three to four is a very common number so you dont have to work very hard to create groups but you can just tell encourage people to turn to the left to right front to back and start forming the groups the second useful question that came up in chat a related to this is what should the instructor do should intervene should keep quiet and it is too so can the guidelines here are not very rigid which means you can experiment and see what works ive seen some instructors who do no intervention in the pair face except try to get quiet students to speak to start talking and some instructors go up and down the class go round the class and look into the pairs notebook see what theyve done give a quick word here and there so if you want some individual attention you wont pay individual attention to some groups you can do it with all groups but to some whoops thats also possible so both are okay strategies there was a one more question on flipped classroom is a course curriculum designed for flipped classroom so firstly such a question has to be asked within the scope of a single discipline or single core single subject there is no worldwide universal curriculum for which was for all subjects and even within a particular course or subject to discipline a i dont think there is the age specific curriculum that has come out but if people have tried and experimented in done research their published research on what theyve done how theyve done and what the research results so that is something you can start reading and finally one goal of the safebuy ppi is that we create a community resource a set of community resources where if you want to come up with your own flipped classroom curriculum you can borrow resources from each other you can use videos that she has created and the assignment that is created put it together share that collected one with your other colleagues and so so thats about the curriculum aspect one more question that we gotten chat ursa what type of feedback should be given to students in the in class activity so this actually depends on the specific activity that is happening and the goal of such feedback should actually to be to help the song student to improve their own learning such feedback is called formative feedback and they do something you give them some constructive feedback saying look that is not working or why do you think so and sos working here is how you can improve it and they revise it right then and there so thats one type of feedback which actually works simply saying yes this is right or no thats wrong is not as effective as trying to get students to realize the reasons why something is working or not walking away a lets take one more question from the hand raise a centre one one six one this is related to the website designing jelly the page navigation from a one a week to the other week is not a given clearly so that the assignments are the test wiki whatever the assignments which is being given by you is not being properly up lol maybe we will look into it so one specific thing that i think people have done us every week every section has now are they going to demarcated as be quite so big to the starting date and the ending date i think this will be oh so itll be in the chronological order so the first week will come on top the second then followed so all the other activities will be there in the following weeks all the activities in beak too including this are sent a interaction the slides and other resources are will be uploaded in week two hours will ensure that the model a flow a is a made proper in becoming a by tomorrow evening thank you for pointing that out none your talking about this modules and modern type of teaching aids which you want to give it to the education sector whether it is engineering college or any other call but most of the people who are in rural areas they cannot affordable to you searcher i enter a cost involved gadgets and infrastructure i think that this is only applicable to the areas where something like metro cities are smart cities what node is the people are talking about it and see where the people are calling it a smart cities all over the india as a lack of infrastructure a lack in the engineering colleges itself wherein this is i dont think you can achieve a hundred percent result oriel add at the most we can reach only one percent of the people through these modules and what the type of program what your talking about wherein we have somewhere around toledan forty colleges in our region and wherein most of the most of the colleges they dont have proper infrastructure this is what the center where we are the type of infrastructure our college provides to us is the best and there are some colleges wouldnt have such infrastructure nor this type of facilities to the er engineering colleges nor even those people are ready to come forward now in such cases i dont think that this type of education will a what your trying to give it to the community or to the students is ruled out so i strongly criticize this time of education but at the same time bizarre initiation from the immature de both at centre and side at state national chastisement programs has to be brought to the areas where the engineering college faculties will be very much a given the training to use such facilities thank you thank you for a different perspective on this i will address where we are coming from at this point or fussy and i dont think the number of colleges or people were reaching is as low as one percent and definitely i agreed not hundred percent but technology infrastructure is growing the center is pushing government is pushing lots of children have mobile phones so one way of looking at this is when we have technology when technology is being pushed on us how do we use it most effectively so we are not saying you see most of the student community you are using mobile phones misusing their time ninety nine percent going to the other content which is irrelevant apart from their education pass so one thing this is how we know our students have these mobile phones we cant avoided so what are somethings we can do to make them use it for more useful reasons secondly if we want large scale outreach professor phatak also mentioned today modern technology is one way to get it we are not saying its the only way we are not enforcing it on anyone but most of you who come here your center what your seeing her this technologies there and what we are trying to do is to try to use it in a more productive so i do not about pushing technology or not its how to use the technology that is available the infamous activities that we win suggesting about active learning these are not new this or not modern these are some things which for several hundred years infact if you look at some of the ancient indian texts they look at the western takes at least for the past hundred years it says that let the students work on their own in class so you can for you have zero technology you can focus on those and still do something more than just getting students to listen okay will take one more question from the center then will move to one percent bn my equally we have begun out to one of the topics in then we started working on strategy and we get we ourselves we we got some doubts regarding this do you think we need to mention about the prerequisites before we start on a particular topic and we do is get during the course of its implementation supposed we come to know that children are now little more control than what we are expecting them to then dont do you think we can repeat the same same flipped classroom again and if we do like that do you think they get bored or do we have to change the complete context okay amy lets go little backwards in terms of the chronology of your questions that suppose were doing a tips and we find that students are not able to answer what we had set for what we do at that time so again these activities have a big advantage for the teacher in the sense it gives you immediate feedback about how much our students are able to do or not do so the advantage of such activities is not just for the student but also for the teacher so yes at that point you if you think its worthwhile telling students to go back and watch the video if you think that will help buoy head suggested if you think it might help for them to view some additional resources not the same thing they saw but something different which also might help them you can suggest that so youre in control here in terms of what you do next so you can mix and match these activities there is no rigid prescribed format there are some recommendations which are what we are repeating over and over that make sure theyre short measure students can do it make sure they sequenced in a way and so are regarding of most western which was about prerequisites so its assumed in general that the teacher is aware of what prerequisites are required for a particular tips when you created because youre the one whos also are taught the previous classes and youre the ones who have assigned the out of class activities so you definitely have to be aware of prerequisites and you design the activity accordingly if you want to mention it to the students that also fine you can in fact tell them the week before saying will have an activity next week where you have to watch these videos are you have to make sure that these prerequisites are met if you like to do that thats also fine last month or during the so question answered no i see that not most participants have been asking about the participation of each and every student in inside the classroom how do we get term moreno convinced that everybodys part is pretty one of the view so what i got one up suggestions what i got from a previous abc conduct a five minute term kind of a survey or i can taste kind of thing in the last to the terms we us faculty would come to know if they have really hated it or not there that might work the system is your kind of evaluation tests are center one zero three nine what is the advantage of api the pojo com faculty had different way of hiking but a bivy giving em em informaiton for all the faculty in how we are a guilty member can implement it thing easily the mindset how you can kill the main thing to answer to that are the main aim of this atp as prose of water can process on hasa reiterated is these things have come to you so how effectively can you make use of it job of the best thing if there is some point of difference between your strategy or you are thinking and what the instructors or the course content designers just find out what the differences are adobe whatever is acceptable and ask questions in these forums and to the other comic a community members participants as to are these differences of ballet a point are these differences valid so you get inputs from multiple people not just faculty so as prose of attack said we are all equals in this particular journey so there arent any right answers to say that all faculty should do exactly like this but there are some guidelines broad guidelines given to you by each of these activities at an abstract sense all these are proven effective through research educational research so educational to suggest something that you should believe in because many people have done it scientifically and deb found evidence so the evidence is the data and the evidences are speaking to you so hence these guidelines for the others it are the implementation varies from context to context and for that you will have to take help from the community to see whether these differences are valid and if they are valid what to do so i think the community will be able to help you a lot and that is why the focus is on building a collaborative community that a wo hours were going to support each other in this particular journey and feel free to test it in your own class you gotta think of this is a toolbox of strife i suggest that you got from the eff do you treat your neighbor tries at the other colleges strait and then you can share your results with each other as recreation center one zero six three and medication change needs to make sure theyre still engineering class sessions and partitioning the question that the participant is asking us canada or the students be given access to the course portfolio i would say i would recommend you to a so if you have a model elements in your own a college i would recommend you to use that particular interface for this are what you say a for the student activity but are otherwise for viewing i think you can show them how the beekeepers organized a per say this if dtype a fourth this particular instance of this episode our students are not given access to this armed because other faculty members are also a present in this but yes as a viewing if if you want to show them how we keys used and other things for demonstration purpose you are free to use it because it is in the open it is an open educational resource providing access i would recommend you arte caution but if it is if there is a local moodle installation i would urge you to put up this oh you wacky in that particular a muddle and try giving access to students cuz you will see more things coming out from that we killed by train then minimize should be available with the tailwind saw the model elemis air should be available for the students to participate otherwise they can only just blew a from the current a interface that you have and give one zero eight to my son ravi had gone through this activity sheet a diffuser to the constructor but its not clear what rituals to be done over here this question is about the tips assignment that has been posted as resource creation appliances oak a basically in the submission we want you to submit your own tips you can take the help of the tips activity constructor within the tips activity constructor we have identified what has to be submitted in the thin face what has to be submitted in the pair face what has to be a put up in the share face so if you look at the examples also the examples also have these elements and it says what instructors what student does what is the deliverable all these things are mentioned in the examples also so we want each of you to create think pair share activities for the in class segment of your course targeting a higher order learning objective this will then be peer reviewed so once you submit and model by may seventeenth this will then move on to peer assessment legal informed worldly girl when it comes to player fees or any other phase so i do have to write according to student or according to me you as a teacher you as a teacher is designing a think pair share activity for your own course assume that you have a course which are going to do next semester designer think pair share activity for your own course setting an assignment okay oh yeah centre one one nine three and doused and thankful to anti bombay or this wonderfull if debby recently we have the maximum number of participants registered at our center that is about lust seventy my question to you son regarding this wiki is exclusively made for the development of a module on moodle moodle only or it can be used for other purposes okay ah the question is whether the buick is exclusively for ra a model are the big key version that your using the u wiki yes develop formed but there are other wikis supiki is of broad odyssey its something like operating system there are different flavors of it so just like how wikipedia is an open wiki which is available there are also a lot of open mic is that are available for everyone some of the examples are media wiki then there is something called picky spaces there is something called wikia all these are examples of open veggies you can use it off four of a larger audience the current one ohio wiki is for a modal activity inside vichy nurser instead of question or comment a many people are asking about his classroom and they dont have the technology for that are probably some of them have missed that or understanding video as a tool for classroom instead of that we can use say newspaper adds more now for the mobile phone compare say a processor and then we can explain the frequency concept or our specification or mechanical engineers and there are many things we can do with the phone with only audio player so that can be used for rural area also is certain is you dont use the internet or cant afford the internet model can be used as a local host so i will request you give details about that in next sessions thanks comments just elaborating a little bit on the previous comment that you can assign different types of information for the out of class component newspapers textbooks go find out some information a classroom does not necessarily mean a one last question from the centre london yes my question is how can i please classroom benefit the students saw a very quick answer and this cond seventh concern than an elaborate a little bit more there was a whole short video called why flipped classrooms last week they will explain in detail how a flipped classroom benefits and now i only want to repeat what i said briefly this morning that what is happening in a flipped classroom is that the in class activities where the teacher is present and piers are present can be used for much richer much deeper types of understanding than merely hearing leech so where do students get access to the information that is typically given in the lecture that happens in the information transmission outside of the classroom either reading or videos or order does matter what form so do more rich in class detail indepth activities in class center one one three nine to my question is regarding a flipped classroom activity although we need to design both in class as well as the outclass the activity of designing a strategy for outer class which factors we need to consider a quick answer to it all you have to do is ensure that your assessment is aligned to the learning objectives of out of classroom activity typically these are lower order you will ensure that the recall understand and apply level questions i have been asked in the out of class segment so if you define a good learning objective for the out of class activity it automatically means those are the things that you need to assess or evaluate an itll also depend on what resources you assigned for them whether go to website to read this article so your learning objective is aligned to the resources you assign them which has to be aligned to the assessment but typically whats recommended is that you dont ask too many in depth complex problems only based on the out of class segment because students have not yet practiced them in the outer class part okay others one point id like to make about flipped classroom are sins again thats been coming up in chat or the idea is that you dont have to convert your entire semester into a flipped mode in fact its recommended that you dont begin like that if your teaching a particular subject which has many modules many topics and if you want to experiment with some of these techniques pick one or two topics pick one to begin with and do a flipped mode version of it then see how it goes refine your strategy may be to one more in the second half of the semester there is no need to convert the entire semester we write in the beginning there are people who have done that and thats fine if you want to do it its fine but its actually quite time consuming so start small get feedback from your peers from others was traded from your students and then you can increase the amount the tutoring center one one zero eight one to ask whether there is any interest and impact on the chicken for restricted access by my students my passion my institutional mechanics can create session selected kind a kitty angel ancient enemy and it had gluten extremist nutcases passion to create an institution there he asked the injunction institutional so do you have a learning management system in your institution something like model installed cheap are basically moodle is a free software you all you need to have a czar the downloads are freely available go to model dot org all your to do is downloaded but you should have a good support team who will manage the courses and a bird regular database backups and all those activities so as a days it is a absolutely free a only thing you should have people who have the know how of maintaining such kind of systems that is going to cost a little bit but we cant keep it restricted to monroe georgia yes a centre one three five five okay so my question is the concept described today how the flipped classroom so i feel that it is very much time consuming and considering the number of students i think that we cant totally ignore the traditional learning procedure if we can do an optimized learning procedure is that we can effectively combine both the traditional way of learning and the slit nozzle together we have an opposite way of learning procedure a complete dashboard my comment regarding this year completely agree with you sir and yes this is the same message that we want to give all other raw people its not just complete icity ah we want more people to a use blending modes that is why this workshop is the ag center one one zero seven ricky confusion regarding large concept in our education system are infants additionally generally considered as the knowledge but in the flip flop flip class concept you are asking that the information transmission is outside the class and assimilation is inside the class cohesion peter conti the curious statement so as you think about the various levels of knowledge and other many such hierarchies information is necessary but not sufficient information knowledge application wisdom you can go higher and higher sinformation is something which is necessary nobodys doubting the need for that but it is not enough just because information exists does not mean that assimilation has happened an application can be done by the learner so i dont believe this is a contradiction if anything what were saying is that information is something with todays reach of the very of the worldwide web or other sources information is easily available today fifty years ago information was mostly available only with teachers that is not the case anymore information is available so let students make use of whats available but it only information which is available whats not available easily still is their methods of problem solving feedback by experts and so on to that still valuable to be done in a face to face setting where either the teacher and the other peers okay lets take one last question and then we will give you a few brief instructions for the lab where you go and actually select videos or audio material and so on or websites for your flip class are so we will take one question how they are more instances for more opportunities available for questions so this is center of one three four five i do to keep the participation levels in the tgs activities i feel unique mary unite nash mercy she probably when we asked our basic freedoms depend of course we can expect almost preppy two section students will be in that activity but later on when they go for pairing i room pink show the people who are present oral who have done the thought process will be actively participating in the pairing activity and finally into the mast base when its repeated versioning page i dont think so the same amount of percentage of students will be having at that level so we can increase this participation a percentage in activities page by page okay let me address this question its a good concluding question to address now so the comment was at the number of people participating in the parents share phases might be lower can we do anything about it so firstly if you look at what happened today in your remote centers this was probably the first time you implemented tips in your own setting and the first time you will do it with your students also may not work very effectively and as a people who repeated this multiple times what they have reported is that it takes about three or four instances of repeating this activity which may be its a once a week or twice a week but after three or four times students also get used to the activity and the amount of participation definitely increases compared to the first one there are a lot of research studies published on this and we urge both attire to bombay and at some neighboring colleges we have done it in classes of two fifties or sixties definitely manageable secondly what you can do specifically to increase it in addition to sort of just do it there for times and a is explained to students why youre doing it and what you think they learn at the end of the activity do a little bit of debriefing as to what they learnt what happened what you can do next and so on and makes
