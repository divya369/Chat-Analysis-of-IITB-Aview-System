link to get feedback or to provide us a feedback for the activity that was done art day soldiers right over here so this survey is intended to give us feedback about what happened about the lab and breakout session we had visited few of the groups where the sessions were going on and we had given them guidance on how to do a certain activities but one thing we realized is that many of the centers op had not completely understood the teacher or presenter view of eve you are which needs to be a properly exploited to make better use of a word you say the ebu conference software and do the breakout session so what we are going to have us over the next half an hour will have our studio team are explained to you the teacher or presenter view of a view and a half hour studio team will be a sufficient from armenia sushant from our studio team will be explaining to you about various functionalities of ebu when you use it as a teacher or as a present the importance of the session is in the fact that many of you will be interacting to a your mentors offer thee oh we are creations will have a group of mentors who will be helping you out in we are creation or with whom you can ask doubts etc so these mentors will be joining onboard a this week a native bombay excause page and next week theyll be interact theyll start interacting with you in eve you so ah this knowledge about a view both as a teacher for now what you do as you view a view as a student or the functionalities are very limited when you do a view as a student so but when you interact with your mentors sometimes the mentor will provide you with additional control as a presenter in which case you can do a lot more with a view like a give a upload documents a do a desktop sharing a chat on the use private chat functionality create pools etc which can then be effectively be utilized for a meaningful interaction so ah ill invite a mister suzanne art for the session so over the next half an hour off or tilted around three thirty you will view a view how to use a view as a present over to mister native a bunker can start and get a good afternoon to everybody this a session should have been given to you earlier but the viral we also realized that we need we have we have to give the session to everybody so that people know everything about a how to handle a view as a teacher you have been using it as a student wheter you have never used it as a teacher so i will be a eunuch was going through all the all the features of a view that can be used as a teacher okay l i share my desktop and i love the show you how a view a interface is used i have just shared my desktop it will be up in a minute at your end jackie there stuff i hope everybody is able to see my desktop right now there is a view screen on my desktop ah can you please reply on chat if you are able to see my desktop please just send a reply yes or no on the chat window okay i see a lot of yes if in case if somebody is not able to see the desktop dont worry we are also recording the session and this will be available offline also and this session is also live on youtube so if your not able to view it on if you just go to youtube or studio eighty be channel and it is our also with the video is also available live right now on youtube also if you are not able to see it on ebay so i hope everybody is able to see my desktop right now so ill start with the avid interface so first what you do is uses a ou you start a view by clicking on this icon regis aview shortening so when you click on this you get a interface tour to type in your username and password so once you view a type in your username and password you are a you enter the classroom and others there are lists of classrooms that are available which you can join so a you have to enter the classroom which you are supposed to join at that time because all the classrooms are available at all all the time but the timing of the classroom is a very specific so now i so like a your a group classrooms were available in the morning but they were they will not be available in the afternoon right now so if you try to join them or join the groups draw now they were their will they or wont be any a person locked in a right now theyre so right now you are a logged in to every week classroom so this is the obdii classroom items that you are available so after you log in first thing you have to do is you have to click on this video but this is the start and stop button of your video though is says video over there this is the start and stop button of your video once you click on this you will get a screen or ill just go from a desktop sharing to a document i would document where i can show you how guys think the document is not available here okay so i hope your tried none of the start button and video button so once you click on that button you ussion interface where you are able to wear where youre able to see hear or see the camera options you have youll be able to see select the camera then select microphone and there is a bandwidth option also there to select so a what most of the people are doing is they think that their bandwidth is okay sudheer selecting five and two and above so what we suggest is whatever your bandwidth is please select two fifty six as your bandwidth when you start the video because a whatever your bandwidth is a few select to fifty sex it will stream seem seamlessly across all the remote centers but if your bandwidth goes down if you select more than five eventful bandwidth i in the s a bandwidth option then if your bandwidth goes down by some reason so some books are some reasons then there might be some problems in the connections or the transmission of the ground so we suggest that every time you a start the video you select with two you start with two fifty six and whips bandwidth keep a standard pci so ah after youve selected your camera then after youve selected your microphone proper microphone when there is a start button once you click the start button i hope youre able to see my desktop right so once you click your start button a video of your own your own live video appears on the righthand side topcon so here right now your saying that my video is available here if your video is not available if the video doesnt start it will show your blank screen that means there is some problem with your capture card or there is some problem with a connection of your camp so once you start your video you should be able to see your own live video on the right hand side topcon so this a assures you that your video is being streamed life after this i just go through this a user list these these four taps this user list chat viewer and question staff so what a this user list is a way where you can see all the users which are connected right right now or whenever you will be locked in in the usa list you will see all the users that are connected right now and were a life there is an avy status checkbox here okay so once you click this heavy checkbox you will also be able to see who have started their video and were not started their video so see if this video a video icon is showing and all those a against all these remote centers that means they video audio audio zone if it shows a cross here that means their video and audio is not on there have not started their video okay so this this ivy status checkbox if you click on that it will show you whos video is available and whos video is not evil so this is a it is not necessary to keep this on all the time because it will also consume your bandwidth so you can ges a check just to check if video is available you can just click on the checkbox and you can de select okay after this a sew or this user list is a wear from where you can select a center to interact so right now what i am doing is i am giving a lecture and this is being streamed live to all the center so everybody is able to listen to me but nobody will be able to a rhino interact with me unless i allow it so far that a teacher has to ueno select center whichever centre has to interact and then a yes to you right click on that center and click on start interaction so once you do that you have to just right click click on start interaction once you do that you have to go to the video wall button this the video wall button i cannot show you right now because i am sharing the desktop if i make a good video wall led others desktop sharing will be closed so once you select a center and you go to this video one button you will be able to see both yourself video and you the a remote centers video and once you select them you will be able to interact and the interaction will be two way so the other center also will be able to interact and his a audio will be available to all other remote centers so this is the way a to select remote cent see are in the viewer option in the viewer tab you will be able to see their video so you have selected a go college and their video is available here so like this you can select a center and a thai video will be available so a so well lot of people a where you know having confusion between after selecting their were not able to see the video so this is because if youre in a document tab or in the whiteboard tab you select a person if you select a center and youre not able to see the video here so right now there is no video select there is no video of a centre here so what happens is once the remote sentry selected the video is available but the video is available in the video world tab or the viewer tab okay so you will have to go to these tabs to see the video okay so we now we have done with the interaction session so then there is a chat module here this stat is a public chat she the in this time but everybody can pose other chat messages so a so whenever there is i know a audio problem or when whenever there is a confusion that if your not audible or if your audible or not you can always post your chat message here and ask everybody if you are audible or not so this is up i know a better way to ask if your audible or not so i dont know keep asking if your audible or not a through your audio itself you can just post it on a chat we just posted on a chat if affordable or not and that people will you know reply so please also make sure you look after the chat window walls when there is a question stab here the question stab is a separately given here because this chart is a public chat people post a lot of unwanted messages also when there are a lot of messages that can come and go here so thats why if you post a question here it might a wow enough get lost in the all the chats so thats why there is a question stab here where you can post specific questions that you have so if you post any questions that you have that that will it will appear here so this up a question stab so now i knew this after earth after this ill show you how to make us a make a student a presenter so this this this thing will be a no usefull for you after this workshop when a you are yourself will be having a mentor mentee interactions at your head so a soity bombay will not be ino a involved in this you alone with your participants will be interacting through eve you at your end so at that time this will be a very usefull for you so right now i assume that you are the teacher liked right now i am the teacher assumes that youre the teacher and you have selected some center so now your selected go college and you are able to interact with them but they will not be able to use any of these features of eve you unless you give and present to control so what you have to do is you will have to de select them first if this if any of you if any of the resource center is selected you have to de select them first after deselecting you have to select the remote center you want to make the presenter so whichever center you want to make the presenter click on that center go down there is a meek presenter option here ill repeat again just left click on that center and then there is a make presenter button once you click that make presenter button what happens is the presenter control goes from your side to the chest to the student whichever you selected and what happens is that person a becomes the present and you are de selected after that a a center becomes a presenter this center she watched the centre should do is heat he or she should start the presentation immediately by just asking yes or no if they are audible on the chat and if they want to interact with the teacher or any other student they have to do the same thing at the as the teacher does too startin interaction once that you get the present to control you become the place the center and you a urbain i you you are being now the teacher and you have all the controls so now you can go to any center you can right click and you can click on start interaction so what i suggest is once you have been given the presenter control you goal you just select the teacher and click on start interaction so that you and teacher will be able to interact otherwise you wont be able to interact so once your selected click on your teacher a right click on a teacher and a click start interaction so that you will be able to interact and the audio video will be on after that so if you are so now if you want to present something so lets say you have a peep or up a video file so we recommend that you if you have a pity you convert into pdf and then upload it on the documents than this i am sorry i just stop the document are okay so there is a document stab here so once you go to this document stab i cannot go to it i write now because absent my desktop if you go on this documents tab you will see a small library option here on this corner so once you click on that library option you will get a pop up window to upload your document so a whatever pity or a new new so whatever puppeteer org a presentation files you have just convert them into pda because a video upload sir very quickly at in eve but pepid is sometimes have a problem to convert them into pda go to the documents tab will get a library option in this corner click on that you get a pop up window where it will ask you to upload your document just suggest a browse your document wherever you document is select your document and click the upload button there will be upload button there if you click on the upload button it will take a forty five seconds to one minute to upload the document depends depending on the size maximum it will take one minute so at that time it will show you some ah it will show you an option here at this a on this tab that the document is uploaded so once you upload the document it will take up under one minute to process the document in its own format and then it will get uploaded and once the documents get uploaded it will be visible here and there will be a two arrows on the top two a ino go forward and backward in the document so that this is how you can upload a document a year then there is a whiteboard tab on this whiteboard tap booty can do is since a we use an an eyeball a techno tablet so so we can euro write anything on the tablet and it appears on the whiteboard but what you can do as you can also use it as a you know her you know you can just type it there is an a if you click on this white board you will get a toolbox on this a right hand side bottom corner or left and right top corner vacated toolbox in the toolbox there are many options to select a pencil or use you can select a home you know the thickness of the pencil or you can select text options if you select text options youll be able to type on the whiteboard so if there is no need for a ueno ma take note or a white i know a writing pad if you click on jazz and click on the text option will be a stable to a write it on the whiteboard then ill skip this video sharing part because is not working properly right now then this is their desktop desktop sharing apps so a right now how am i how i have sir ueno shared the desktop the same way you can click on this desktop then there will be a two options here this is a screen area then there is an application sought screen area disease if you click on screen area and start desktop sharing it will give you a whole screen of your desktop the whole screen will be visible right now your aview is visible right now so now my desktop is visible if i open a puppy it will be visible whatever happens on my desktop is visible this is the option when you select the screen area then there is another option that the application this app what this earned option does is if you click on this application button and then start a application button a pop up box will appear which will show you all the applications that are open on your desktop so right now there are those

shows a black screen so whenever i open up the chrome russo that time only youll be able to see the chrome browser so that is the a ueno point of this application sharing and screensharing camera just sharing my desktop the whole screen again so these are what are the desktop screen area and application sharing is for all about this video the ill skip this radiant today viewer there is no then there is a video walberton video wall button is when you are not presenting anything users want to interact face to face so if your selected up a person if you selected any remote center and you want to interact face to face the time you have to click on this video wall button once you click on the view all button you liverpool but to see your own video on this a right hand side corner in a small window and you will be able to see a very big a video of the center in this middle con in this middle a screen of the year so thats how you can i know interact face to face okay then there is a polling option here since this polling option is like a nano my cbc reassembling where you ask a question and you know as you ask people to just enough press a o you if you have been given four options and you ask people to a select anya anyone option so this polling is like that one what this polling option has is the if you click on this polling option there will be a a there will be a a option there will be a button to enter your question so whatever if you have a question and you have four options you can just enter that question and then there will be options to enter your a the

once they submitted you will be able to they will be a button to view statistics so one shook a checkbox whence a onesie checkbox your question and click on view statistics it will show you how many people have answered one have any people advanced too how many people have anxiety so these are very quick i know a quick way to get response to questions but use a bit of course youll have to have those questions ready adherent first with the options to get this or this was all about alice a tabs and features that are available which can be used as a teacher but i remember once you gay give the presenter control to someone the presented the presenter control goes to that person and you are a disconnected as your audio video is disconnected and he becomes a teacher so he has two select you in a to be able to interact on your face to face so remember that this the presenter control button okay theres one more important setting once you go to the video wall button once you go does video wall button are actually the default setting is a it shows a very small box of video both the presenter and the teacher here but you can you know a change that option there is a settings button on the right hand side corner once you go go to the video wall button there is a settings button on the right side top corner if you click and click on that there is a video layout button at the bar at the last if you click on that video layout button and if you select the middle option then you will be able to see a very big video of the present ill repeat this a right on the right hand side top corner once you click on the video all button on the rightness of sight of corner their previous settings button once you click on that settings button a popup will appear you have to click on the video layout button and select the middle option which will give you a way bigger picture of the scent rather than being a small small a ino boxes of pictures this year and so what these features whatever y features are that i showed you documents desktop video wall these features will only be available to you once you have the presenter control less you have the present control you will not be able to use these features okay so one you will have to have a present to control a two or two a use all these options so youll have to ask the a the presenter to give you the predator control so that you can use these options so they this was iris knew this was a thing which happened in this group discussions a lot that they were not able to know the teacher said you start presenting and the student was not able to use all his options because they didnt they also did know that how this pressed presenter control works so these were all the features that can be done and that can be used as a presenter and that can be used when you you will be interacting with your present us with your students after this workshop are geeky so thats all from now from my side and was the control to jackie again i do if you have sweaty questions okay if you have any questions relating to this session i fuk there you can handle is now ill just release all the hand rises if you have any questions regarding this

regarding mike boone yes his distinction as a mixture of liberate lot especion some okay writing mathematical expressions easily as you suggested that i had one would know that youre using so what we are using is what we are using is this a i eyeball take note okay this balance you have this connection reuse be okay i have that reynolds but events in need suggestion that the advance version as it now we are actually suggest others sat eyeball take not only because this is a cheaper option and the whiteboard is not that vino smooth eula its its better you know its better to wear users you know any other a enough software on your desktop and you share the dust murky whiteboard here is can be used but you have to know be careful while writing and i know why because if you write very fast it is not that smooth so ill have to i know be careful with that your audio is gone check you might want ye not audibles just check the mike a iphone mania wildwood can use to ueno typiy a broadcast messages or anything like that that can be that can also be used or orange if you have the technote anose your still not audible if you of the take note there is a software called exo ex justin medlock type the name of the software on the chat so you are anyway so this ave type the a softer name in the chat so you are a nail this software you just open the software and you can i use that take note in this software also and it gives away a gives you very smooth the writing goals so you can use their software and you just desktop we share your desk than a year old would tend to emerge and oh yes the epistemic value mid afternoon sessions chile india morning when we were conducting the session as a teacher group okay so my a participant was presenting a video sharing the desktop orgasm while the video was on a wwe not been able to see if the viewers can see that because by the time the connection got lost if you remember okay okay in the morning readily afternoon twins after twill trudy hogle zoo weeding come to know when exactly the connection good africa the video was going on but we didnt knew that neither the viewers were able to see radio noon okay so that the so this disconnection problem was because of a new era there was a problem and i promise overall only so this can happen at your diet at your end note it is not the issues and how they wanted you know actually our videos being a nurse weeding come to know that the connection is lost how can we come to know as a group are okay so what you can really say there are a hell of a default is like a what is there in the users list okay you see the users list always right that a writer lifted her left hand side so if you see a users connected there that is one option others were actually the we shared did they stop and from sharing the dystopia opened the desktop and a we had a son played the video so we could only serve video in the full scene so i was not been able to see that ive you a screen there at all okay okay autonomy goodafternoon sir so i got your problem the problem is that when you sharing the video then you minimize a risk you dont know that when it was disconnected minimize year so we dont recommend to use the textbook sharing for the video the problem is sharing that explore his lucky it uses only one frame per second and video usage was the twenty four to forty poems so that i wont be effective so if you are a video you sweden click upload the video on youtube and share that or you should upload the video on the interface of a view and then share and for the problem and josie coded the video then you can just play that video in the library and you can say that at what time it was available to you or to the viewer and we will be given another slot in the next week to do the activity of this group and later you can do the if it is it was not successful the second time when we got connected we again who did so we started on the first thing i mean the very bursting because we didnt knew when it got disconnected we did it so it was all a lonely smoothly done thank you thank you sir hey mrs pillay urban zero zero unicast question regarding the

educational resource creation and report writing so you should utilize your mentors expertise in creating your own or open educational resource and you kept you could do a you could get an evaluation from them about how your activities is a targeting appropriate levels etc and that is the purpose of this mentor mentee interaction and looser mallards quickly yeah there are seven now seven participants considered okay re of the man whom one luminary electrical engineeri okay ryan unveiled women each distillery electronics and telecommunication and only then we which is home computer application domain okay that single person do we are or not no sew single person group is completely not allowed in for we are creation we are going to create a discussion forum in ab iety bombay ex where we will be posting dividing it based on the domains so you can go to the respective domains so youll be related to computers and computer science and related domain the person in computer application will be in the domain computer science and allied so you could you could go to that particular discussion forum and look for are people who are a a look for people who are alone or a try to see if there are groups who could accommodate one more person a in dirty old dirty bit uneasy guess from other horses if nothing works out a if you are not able to get anyone till twentieth please inform us so that we could also talk to other course coordinators and try to put you in a particular team okay okay okay we did you tour participants so in exceptional in exceptional circumstances we would allow force oppor participants okay let me now go to are see one one four six knowledge institute of technology your archive and one for six emmy edible yes go luckily i raise my hand to give speed up the last two days yeah tell me please no problem but the thing is that yesterday weve done what we can we do have done it but the thing is that time sufficiency was remotely sexually this would we feel from acid okay but what does that activity what was the topic of which model activity adabas database database database urine which group creating a database at eden ati grouper group for a very able to participate in the breakout sessions i have you participated in breakout session the morning okay until you have done it and you presented it okay but i i hope that we havent done completely what are the things entirely details yarn given ethos yeah see ah that was never the see a complete mastery of a database activity was never the intention of this a particular exercise the exercise was that you will be able to so the rationale of this exercise was that you will be able to search for the information you will be able to find out necessary information collated synthesized and then create something new so this is what any new teacher would do suppose you have to so suppose you are given a new topic and asked to create a lecture tomorrow you will be doing the same thing right so this exercise was a simulation of that particular thing for you will know what to look for an ar todays activity when you get when you see what others have done what others have a a done for the same particular activity you will also get to know what they have also seen okay so this was only a exercise too exp a let you experience in terms of us as a student what active learning us and what active learning actually means so you as a learner as a learner you try to get information try to make sense of it and synthesized and this is what you are sure does and now you have given me an excellent feedback saying that you yourself are not satisfied with whatever you have done in terms of the synthesis i mean there is no better learning than what you have just said right now so the exercises meant to elicit that only okay so do not worry if even if you havent learnt fully but at least now you can be assured that you have the sufficient skill set to explore and make more out of it and this is what any facilitator should do any learner should do any teacher should thank you again okay let me now go to are see one two two five three one two two five soy arcy one two three five doctor mahalingam college of engineering it is slightly amusing when you actually realize that you are suddenly on screen yeah please go adventure yeah so many in the breakout session okay and agnew with leading a affair connected okay yeah charging and wilshire oak a great do you have any queries or any questions to ask me a regarding the activity that you dont accidentally terminology sessions participate in the next week this breakout session i mean these are the are you talking of the alternate abu sessions here no soap i mean if you have participated in the abu today so the alternate sessions are for those people who are unable to pass a present their work or get connected to the abu system keeping is okay so this is or see one four double zero are not able to see your video but please go ahead and ask the question womans polytechnique puducherry winning sir good evening the censor here in our r see the indigenous peoples and attending the games okay honoring a different domains okay is it is it compulsory to form a basis in the domain or we can combine the apples see ah so this question as a general question that many horses would also be so i would request all artsy stoke are closely listen to this answer so are there is a scenario where people are from different domains and it is very difficult too or a group people for the we are in a single domain from the artsy now there are two ways of solving this the first one is that you select up between yourself you decide on a topic in a particular domain and work on it were all three can provide some input there are fourteen common domains are that we are putting up a a thirteen of them are subject specific and one common domain on educational technology so you could select a common domain of educational technology and create resources for the or you could select any one of those common subject domains are that people are comfortable with and formati so this is the firsts a way in which you can solve it the second way is that will be opening up specific discussion forums on may fifteenth a bear we will do a will be putting up discussion forums for each of the dome its so there are fourteen including like a electrical and allied computer and allied mathematics science so there are fourteen different domains that we have identified so will be putting up discussion forums for each of these are as each participant please go through these forums and poe try to find out people in these forums by posting messages and trying interact i think with your friends or other item ex participates so youll be able to find out of people from other horses and together once you decide inform your course coordinator that you will be forming a team with a person from another or see and youll be forming a team if till twentieth you are unable to form a team please inform your course coordinator and course coordinator you are requested to consolidate all the people in your ar see who are not able to form a team by twentieth an inform e outreach so that we could match the peoples domain and try to find out a suitable people from other horses answer is that finds no thanks for your kind information yeah so let me now go to are see one four one one a colossal income are universally allow here yes yes you are audible at the same distillery incidentally italy vision region
