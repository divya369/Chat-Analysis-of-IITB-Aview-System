we would expect discussions amongst themes amongst all the parties that is where the knowledge that we gain gets consolidated we can raise some common doubts these could be communicated to eighty bombay or put on the discussion forum and all of us will become wiser through such discussions and interaction that is the reason why we at said right upfront that participation in this critical part is mandatory now it is possible that for some genuine reason someone may not be able to attain either a session after session first of all it should be avoided the reason must be very serious for your not be able to participate and even in such case when when you are not able to participate in this critical part because some genuine reason one you must inform the workshop coordinator at your remote center and inform the itee bombay team of your absence more important than that if for some genuine reason your absent it is your responsibility to makeup for your apps how do you makeup for your absence immediately find out from the workshop moderator and from other colleagues what exactly transpire if there was an activity which was required to be completed during the face to face interaction sessions such as in the labs in the afternoon you are expected to complete them either individually or with the help of remote center coordinator workshop coordinator but you must complete those activities because that is part and parcel of their safety so i hope i am very clear nobody is supposed to miss these interactions it is not adequate that you come sign your presence in the morning and then disappear for the session that is in fact worse because what is expected of you is that you participate and contribute to the discussions that happen within the participants group assembled at any artsy and participate similarly in the labs so i hope i am very clear on this and i hope that if there has been any absence because some genuine reasons if previously the matter has not been reported we do get some i email saying that someone is not able to attain this data that day we presume that the person is taking care of making up for the absence by interacting with the workshop coordinator and other team members if not done so so far please start doing it in case you missed this or the next the second matter is more serious and unfortunately far more unpleasant this relates to assignment submissions as you know the multiple individual assignments were required to be submitted in the first four weeks these where we are assessed individually submitted there are several individual online research which were expected to be done in coming weeks you will be doing team assignments as well as individual assignments for example today press the shutter has given an assignment part of that is a team assignment which will work during the lab sessions today i believe that the team leader of every team is supposed to submit some getaway people desire by scanning two three four pages that you your team prepares and then uploading that as a team assignment that is more for a record of course each members the team should carry these three or four pages paper design and subsequently work individually to prepare a simple website as he has directed that will be peer assessed later add after the assignment from now when i am doing such assignments submissions either individually as a member of the team i have also agreed that all these assignments including for example the course material and other lectures i recorded lectures recorded interaction etcetera i remember we have said that we will release all of this in open source rival agreed for that and the objective is that the combined learning by all of us is actually made available to a much wider body of kali teachers across the country and perhaps elsewhere in the world this is all good intentions but latency unfortunately what has happened before i tell you what has actually happened in this every pee i would like to comment on a keyword called plagiarism i hope all of you have heard about this world if not please understand the exact meaning of this when a piece of work done by one person is copied by another person and submitted by the second person as his or her own work without clearly acknowledging the original author is termed as pleasure in common parlance we call this copy there are multiple instances when such copying can happen for example students copying answers in an examination or students copy either a complete assignment or a part of an assignment when theyre required to submit it as a part of the course or subject that we teach amongst grownups unfortunately such copying happens when some part to the research were dug by a kali either now or earlier is copied and verbatim reproduced and but it is reproduced as my work now when i do this it is actually copying of a research paper part of research paper copying of this is all of these are examples of plagiarism needless to say such plagiarism is simply not accepted why the temptation occurs to pleasuring so let me put my points all of your aware of this number one i am a student all i am a participant in a workshop like this i do not have time to do the work on my own but i need to submit something within a deadline so i may be tempted then i dont have time but somebody some friend of mine has done something okay since there are four thousand people submitting assignments maybe it will pass away just copy his or her assignment and submit as my own the other reason could be i am unable to do the work myself because perhaps have not prepared have not studied properly but i have a compulsion to submit because either marks are involved if i am a student or a certificate is involved if i am a teacher in our case surely a certificate recognized by eyes it is involved and that could tempt me if either i am inadequately prepared all i do not have time i might think it shallow i will just take somebodys submission copy it and submit when i do so i do it in the belief that one my act will not be caught or no obviously that if my act this court they could be some penalty but i presume i believe that this act may not be the second even if there is some risk of being caught i assess that risk and i say all right therefore thousand people in this every peoria submitting even if they catch so what could be the penalty perhaps likely to be no penalty or perhaps likely to be minimal penalty i consciously decide that i am willing to take that risk and the moment my mind except that race i become prey to the temptation now i am tempted to copy something submit it as my own the first time it happens it is not caught i am not penalized i am tempted to do it the second time this is actually part of a generic value system that crumbles if efforts are not made to curb such depth i am not blaming anyone this is a human nature all of us are great optimizers all of us as human beings would write like to try to minimize our efforts and maximize our gains and such temptation sucker for marks among students for recognition or certifications among faculty for money amongst people who are grown up and that is what we call corruption in fact or for fame for whatever reason in fact the entire societal value system actually attempts to promote a understanding that such things are bad at such things should not be done that is the reason why we have legal systems justice punishment etc that is because whatever we dub as bad should not happen if someone does a bad thing there must be at least the weapon the knuckle or a severe penalty depending upon the act and the severity of the app now this i speak generically but let me come back to the academic value which is what concerns us most at this first and foremost all of us should understand one thing about digital submissions which is what is happening in this every ppi and which is what will happen increasingly in coming years in decades not only for every piece but even for teaching that we normally those of you who teach in an environment with reasonable computerized facilities available such as programming assignments for example a nighty bombay they all submitted onlye now whenever you submit anything on lie in a digital form the first and foremost thing that i must understand that if i made a submission that submission remains as a record it cannot be refuted what it means is if i have submitted something whatever it is my own or anybody elses copied whatever if you submitted something when it was submitted who submitted it and what was submitted all of this remains as a record in a server generally far removed from myself so whenever i submit i must understand that it is not for now even one year later ten years later that submission can be examined and it can be established who submitted it when it was submitted and what exactly your submit that cannot be refuted more importantly if such submissions contain text then the text can be auto analyze auto analyze means what i do not know whether your heard of a software called turnitin turnitin is actually a repository of an extremely large number of research paper shell tell you how we use this turn it and it helps us to find out if a new research paper that comes to me contains any paragraphs or similarity with any another previously published lakhs of result you know how we use it sometimes our imtech students or if the students when they submit their internal reports let us sell literatures are now a literature survey is by definition a survey of what others have done but theyre our instructions are crystal clear if you survey somebody essays paper the number one you must acknowledge that person you must cite that persons their main research in the literature survey bug and number two you are required to re phrase the wordings used by that researcher in his or her publication you are not permitted to reproduce it verbatim if you do that youd put it down i will quote as a potential many research scholars many emtec students are often tempted to either omit the referrals ooze somebody elses work as ones own work what we do is every time we get a submission we actually passes through this turn it in software and this tourney then very nicely gives me the percentage of the material in this paper which appears to be common with this paper that paper that paper what it means is that if my student has been tempted to copy from somebody elses paper ninety nine per cent i will be able to discover it at the first attempt when i see that at therefore i can collaborate i can how did my research colorway text to tell if this nonsense must stop makes that person rewrite it and re submit with the normal use of tally please note that when such material which has been copied but without acknowledgment is put in public domain and remember if a submission to a research conference is a public domain sabi a submission such as you make are this afc is incidentally also a public domain submission you are submitting it to a common side which is committed i the bombay is committed as you all know to collect all of this and put it in open source for public good which means that if such plagiarized material is put in public domain it may cause very serious damage to the reputation of both the individual and to the institution the individual belongs suppose i am a teacher in one of the colleges and i am tempted to plagiarise something and submit that assignment then if that act is scott i will be put to shame my suit will be put to shame and additionally unfortuanately i te bombay will be put to shame with heidi bombay permitted such material to be released in options all of this you would agree must be avoided now i come to the main point the penalty of the that the academy community imposes on such plagiarism whenever it is detected could be very severe because this is considered a very serious matter global we often talk of developed countries and developing country we often have a wrong impression that developed country means a rich country developing country means a poor country while that may be so the poverty is not merely in terms of money and riches the power is also in terms of discipline both self discipline and social discipline the matter of plagiarism is taken extremely seriously in all development and in fact it is taken very seriously globally particularly in academics so in case of students this may result in a fail grade or even expulsion this happens tonight bob will have been teaching for fourty five years i always know that even if you get less marks its okay but if you copy anything will get a fail grade immediately in the course and the matter will be reported to the issuing authority there are cases where the issued authorities have decided to expel such today just too it sure that the rigour of the academic values is meant as such is the case that is followed everywhere practically in global academics certainly also in india after all you as teachers were you supervise examinations and we you know that some schools have copied down to take similar action you do sadly if it happens with teachers what should be done obviously a very serious action must be taken by the concerned authority now when detected a penalty is always imposed is the underlying fact i would like all collect just knowing we do it for our students we must do it for ourselves as well if such a thing sorry for this link the backroad but let me come to the point very sad point in my life of conducting sewin every piece copying of assignments in this epk has happened several cases have been detected yet established now as i speak more auto analysis is happening that means very shortly for all the submissions that have been already made and the submissions that will be made in future we apply the same thing we will do a detailed analysis both manual and automatic to determine if there is any copying please remember that such occurrences are simply unacceptable in fact ill go one step forward and i will say that even helping someone do this is raw suppose a friend comes to me and i say he tells me a baby im not able to understand this or will you please give me your assignment so i will upload it as my end because he is my friend i say okay go ahead and do that it is wrong in fact it is worse please remember if i give my assignment to a friend i am not acting as his other friend i am actually acting as his or her enemy i am jeopardizing his or her chances of learning number one and i am putting him or her at great risk because if the matter is caught the person would be deeply pinella and some of that mud will stick to my clothes as well grab the person was help so please remember we all must collectively it sure that such nonsense does not happen at all as far as the normal penalties concern for such copy when it happens in the case of an epc for example going by the same knobs that we apply to the students these are the norms that we have decided these norms are number one in every such case where it is detected and please remember it is not a question of one assignment or two assignments are ala said copying is copying is copying theft is theft is a thing if that happens then the penalty ordinarily would be number one certificate of every pic completion is dinner even if a certificate is issued and the case is detected later such certification can be rebo obvious penalty like giving a fail get westwood report the names to the authority which are the authorities in this particular case the authorities govern you inut i bombed while of course reported toiety bombay as a matter of reporting but the battle will be reported to institution in which you serve and to acid second at the third and most important thing but we have decided if we will display the list of such people publicly on enemy ai city website please remember that we have to ensure that number one such acts do not happen and number two if such acts happen then an appropriate penalties imposed well many of you might be culturally even those not indulge in any plagiarism may be considering that this penalty is too harsh environment this penalty is too harsh but this is the penalty that we have been giving to our students for decades and there is no reason to assume that a similar penalty should not be imposed for the fairy very mean act of falling prey to the temptation of copying and submitting something as my own the site is a criminal activity academically and this must be penalized but since this might be the first occasion when colleague teachers are tempted to do this after all it is not very often that we teachers have to submit assignments only when we attend a fd be particularly hard if dip is such as this were a lot of work is required to be done and all of us are compelled by circumstances to spend our time in several other things including our duties or family commitments so it is quite possible that i did not get enough time or i could not prepare much add assuming that the risk is not much i was tempted to do this tally for the first time since such a possibility exists my colleagues have advised me to permit one opportunity which will result in a softer penile let me describe the process that i have decided to follow this is the alternative this alternative will provide an opportunity to all participants if a participant has been tempted to copy and submit then the participant will get a chance to admit even as given in to such temptation every such admission must result in complete details being given which assignment was copied when from further the participants must commit not to do so ever again because after all were all trying to establish academic value and re do and submit the plagiarists submission that means suppose i was tempted to copy to assignments in the past i must re do those assignments now truly on my own and submit them of course i will not get any marks or credits for those side let me tell you this is truly a soft alternative for example if i have copied lets a two out of three assignments i required to resubmit them after admitting that have appeared when i re submit those to assignments i still dont get any man do i lose the opportunity to get a certificate because possibly have done enough hard work for remaining every ppi you will notice the grading policy that has been announced allocates only a smaller percentage of marks for the submission of your assigned all right if a puppy to assignments by falling into temptation then i will loose submission marks for those to a side but there are enough activities that have happened the past and they will be enough activities going forward which will permit me to get a minimum score in this every ppi so that i am able to get a proper certificate of completion sol is not lost i still have a chance and i get an opportunity to correct much of course how do we implement this for example so there is one more point which have not written here but which is uppermost in my must see for example even when my students are concerned and they have been occasions in the past they have given them similar opportunity i do not want them to publicly confess in fact if someone has fallen into temptation one is already feeling sad about it and one would feel very humble if it becomes known publicly that i have done this copy so what i do is i say look you admit but you admit to me only not to anyone else and i promise not to divulge your name to anyone else because your self esteem is important to me i am also a human you are of striking i have therefore decided that this alternate you shall be implemented through an obligatory survey or all participants will be putting up this obligatory survey or obligatory feedback exercise every participant all participants all four thousand participants who have registered in his role and who have made any submissions so far whether they are continuing to engage with this every ppi further or not it does not matter even a single submission made and suppose i did not find time i was involved in some other activities and had to give up attending subsequent sessions of this every ppi still one submission that i have made i am accountable for that submission and therefore i must fill up this obligatory feedback exes there shall be set up on the model where every participant must i say that look i have that copy to be a silent period i state so my survey too if ive been tempted to copy the assignment then i will give all the details this will not be an anonymous survey because i must know who is a war however normally as you know woodell surveys are visible to many peoples number one the first thing visible is how many people have submitted that is the reason why making it obligatory for everyone to submit the suppose they are i i was tempted to copy and they were exactly a hundred people like me then those hundred people will only submit their names will be visible and everybody will know array these hundred jokers up its something that will reduce my self esteem we do not want that map therefore this survey shall be obligatory for everyone that means if there are four thousand and eighty three thousand five hundred whatever number of actual enrolled participants each one must suffer so obviously anybody looking at that survey will only see so many people have submitted all of them of course what they have submitted however will not be visible now here is a trick moodle normally permits teachers teaching assistants non editing teachers to look at the entire analysis and that ways to look at every individual submissions this also is bad suppose for example i was tempted to copy something i am in some remote center acts where i participated now as you all i have just mentioned i would not like people to do that i have done this but if i submit this survey and my workshop coordinator was to read it if ten other faculty members a unity bombay or teaching assistants everywhere was to read it i will lose myself so we are setting up a mechanism such that this feedback survey submissions will not be visible will not be visible to non editing teachers will not be visible to workshop work orders his survey results will be visible only to a small group of senior faculty at id analytics personal responsibility second we will never make public the detailed submissions that are given by individuals that is my personal prompts is because as i said earlier i value the self esteem of every individual and certainly that of a colleague but given this guarantee it is very very important that every faculty member participating in this evthe thus complete this obligatory feedback exercise and exonerates oneself even has been tempted or states very proudly that look i have never done this and i dont need to do is help me to collectively establish strong academic value this is something which is very very important i will conclude by saying that we as teachers are not only responsible to teach subjects to our sport of course we do we also know that students are clever enough to learn these subjects on their own often however our main job is to motivate them to help them try to get enthusiastic about learning something and still more important job to pass on the right value systems to the youth of the country that is our jaw please note that our students whether you like it or not our spoons old us in some high esteem in fact they actually tried to see role models in us our behavior is taken by them as if its a model behaviour if it comes to be known that we ourselves are so weak in our value do you think our students will learn better value on the other hand if our students are convinced that we are committed to establish and follow good value system then perhaps there is a chance that many students if not all will follow that value system and say yes thats the right way to once again i apologize for taking a lot of your time in this important part of face to face interaction where we have a whole lot of very important and useful things to do but i felt that this was extremely critical i felt that i should not act one way only by imposing the penalties that are normally to be done and that i must offer an alternative for those colleagues who have unfortunately fallen prey to such temptations perhaps for the first time in this episode so i will just repeat this this survey will be put up two to three days later there will be a type be read about four to five days in which your to submit the survey but please remember that those of you been tempted to copy start assembling quietly within yourself all the records which assignment yet copied with you submitted that and from whom your copy will be required to give that those of us who have not indulge in such unfortunate practice of course just have to say look i have not done this and that would be the end of the bat i repeat again if this is done we will not impose the normal penalty such participants are most welcome to continue to benefit from this every ppi there will even be given a certificate of completion if therefore the minimum required marks or grades in the remaining part of the eyes of the courts and of course in the other assignments they have not copied and there is a very good chance because a large amount of such assessment is yet to be done i will conclude by saying ill enjoy this evthe notwithstanding whatever asset but please do reflect prototype said please do discuss amongst your route groups if you have any suggestions to make any observations to make please make them in a generic way not naming any person not showing any disrespect for any individual because we are all colleagues but if you have any general opinions if you have any general observations please do make them because collectively our wisdom should prevail on all of us and later on all the lacks of teachers to establish and nurture great academic well i would like you to get over this shop i am still reeling under the shock have not got over this well frankly i never in my life expected that colleague teachers from other institutions would be tempted to do something i will come out of the shock but i hope you agree that this is the only way forward we have no choice people were caught but do not admit for making that mistake will have to be penalized the penalty they have outline will be explicitly followed we will report the date of such people to the authorities namely their own institution and to a city and will publicize that that is the minimum that must happen of course such people will not be given completion certificate however i request you earnestly to consider the alternative this alternative is sadly not only for those people were tempted to do such a mistake but is obligatory for everyone and why it is obligatory for everyone so that individual names are protected so that nobody knows where the people who would have puppy as i promised since i respect the self esteem of every individual has all of you do it is very very important that even such admissions of mistakes should not be publicly known sign promising once again that these will be known only to me and to a handful of my colleagues i am promising that this correspondence and this survey result will never be made public will never be shared by anyone else i shall always remain with us but with this we shall be able to proceed further in the remaining part of the every ppi to do something useful for us and for everyone there are four hand raises i will take those observations and comments from marathwada institute of technology over to you in on some submissions made the blind permits and submitted as it is the structures given by the idea for me they are submitted as it is downloaded and again submitted as they work and there are some null values given as some excuse to be given one prove something is uploaded we have made the assessment that this is not right there is this is not to be done see again it but whether there has been taken here in the final assessment or not i do not know how the local assessment is being done i will have to check up with the hijack christian process is a rare and suana steam to find out what they have done however there are two aspects i would suggest what is of course the assessment and the marks that are allotted to people the second and more important thing is all our colleagues were made such submission have obviously made mistakes so they have to be told that what should be the right response or what should be what mistakes should be avoided i will have to talk to my colleague professors to find out how they are conducting the assessment but very obviously if have re submitted something which was given to me as a format they obviously that is not a proper assignment i deserve to get zero marks or if have not submitted correct values and have some null values i should not get proper marks in that assessment i dont know how theyre handling it but thank you for pointing this out will take care of their situation any other observation please i said we are doing badly in moodle and unworthy in with a wiki so we are facing some problem how we act uploaded nabiki in our submission any give some idea in wiki have unanswered as a degrading activity shall be considered only that a module and ady boundary they cite only consider project creating a credit that is a wiki also yard they finally we are submitting some docman in wiki how either this will be considered the grading activity pages only the timing we are doing any gives him the best of my knowledge the grading is to be done and the submissions made on moodle and submissions meadow native bombay there is the best of my non wiki summary patients are encouraged we also encourage our students to submit on wiki because wiki maintains a comprehensive record of all the related things which are put together you will notice that the vichy submissions will permit comprehensive single collection of all related submissions if you read the grading policy the grading policy clearly states that in the course portfolio wiki the submission that you have given is also assessed and there are two marks portion assigned to that so you will notice that the lab session submissions as to marks and course portfolio wiki submission is to mark this pertains to the first four weeks that were conducted by process enabled the procedure a year and jack however the second component which is now ongoing does not have any proportion to wiki i hope that is clear thank you let us go to another institution i became his colleague iphigenie a this is regarding the plagiarism are essential in ipcc multi multi choice questions are we have to approach is generally one is what you are sober so have deliberated on ethical approach why country adopt along with this a technological approach like instead of only five questions i mean why same questions to all of us my different questions we can create a question bank and randomly a program that can generate different questions to different this will be probably a a a now a sort of a preventive method rather than a curative thank you very much for this suggestion to inform you there are some courses which we run where we do such randomization which is possible on the itee bombay ics platform for example a programming course which i run we get about ten thousand variations of every quiz question that goes out so even if there are ten thousand students attempting the quail nobody gets the same way it is not merely the a permutation of the choices but in the programming question for example if i ask people to analyze a program and ask them what would be the output of this program if input is a music would two arrows equal to four hour randomization scrape actually permits us to generate questions with different values of feminine and it generates proper set of answers with those value not only that if i am a student and if i get one quiz today and i answer that quite obviously the specific fees will be different from any other quail and tomorrow if i complained that look this is what i had answered i have a record by the bombay ics platform on what exact quiz was given to me so that there is no dispute such technological features are available unfortunately for this particular every ppi in the quizzes that we have conducted so far we were not able to implement such coding or scripting for randomization however to demonstrate your point and am very thankful that you raise this point let me use this opportunity to tell everyone else that the colleague from a famous college is raising actually very important point because later on when we use this technology for our students and if hundreds students are sitting in the lab they could be obviously copying from neighbors in the quiz answers graces are online quizzes i am actually teaching at this case one on course for the summer back in high demand maybe right now i qatifi students wall sit in the lab next to each other but believe me everybody gets you online quiz with a different question every if a set of equations is different for everyone we absolutely no chance of coping in fact in the first lap my students try to look here and there the neighbor and when they discovered that this idiotic professor has done some fancy stuff and everybody is getting a different question they stop looking here and there and started us as a big way so once again sorry for the elaborate explanation but i am grateful that you raise this issue to demonstrate that this can be done a nighty bombay acts in the week when i will discuss the features of moocs platform to demonstrate this i will actually create that ways discussed how such randomization is done in this particular platform and encourage all of us to use such randomization in future thank you once again thank you theresa two more supplements led to further add on to the idiocity what you are already very normally suggested why cant our lab sessions in our lab sessions we can create some questions and send it which can become a question bank are very well said in fact one of the motivations that i had while designing the last portion of the every ppi namely creation and nurturing of collaborative community and also the final submission specification which is a team effort for creating an oh yeah i do have in mind that the open educational resource that would be created by many teams would actually be a set of such quiz questions pertaining to a specific domain or subdomain the last supplement you are coming back your unethical approach i kindly request to encourage those were doing and sincerely and who really have got some difficulties either either in time are especially the technical slag you can kindly consider extending the resubmission especially those have demanded will in time so many of us we could not load utma upload our assignments in time but we missed very marginally the technology can clearly say who has missed wasnt missed you can it that this will encourage those who are doing sincerely to do give some consideration and to give them a second chance may not be for everybody a technology can be well utilized to see who desires and who doesnt have a very good and important point that your mate i have not made any announcement in this regard so our rules as of now remain firm that if you miss a deadline then your submission will not be access i will talk to my colleague whether the submission dates could be defined such that there is the deadline for submission in assessment but if i missed the deadline i am still permitted to submit whether it is considered for marking or not is a different matter but ive a record of all such submissions and as you said technologically i can assess where the people who submitted within five minutes half an hour one hour or one day of that and not ten days later and give appropriate credit this credit cannot be given in terms of marks because we already announced our grading scheme but ill tell you what i propose to discuss with my own cali we have decided that people must get minimum fifty per cent score in all quantitative assessment what i will do is and that is what we do in our relative grading to our students also that if we find a number of faculty members scoring close to fifty per cent but not crossing that fifty percent barrier then in all such cases we will examine when they have submitted and if theyve submitted just missing the deadline then will consider that and lower what we call the passing percentage so that serious minded people were sincerely up our trying to do something do not suffer and they will get call we agree it is points thank you thank you anonymous college jaipur over to you a question related to an undergraduate degree program and post graduate programme in be tech programme repertoire assignment as well as the laboratorys work in that most of the undergraduate student is generally copy how to stop that first question is that and if we talk about the impact this is another part even the seminar ent of mythic rico air although how much a level of pleasure in these public records even if it get by i authenticate or turnit we caterpie topware term limitation is that beyond that limitation we cannot omit so kindly suggest as a hired made one suggestion to a city which will repeat for all our colleague participants to seriously consider we have found the best bet is that all mps thic dissertation and all be take project reports must be compulsorily put on the institute website there must be publicly available is remember that half the problems that happen in any society is because of non transparency if i submit the name take this and lets have copied your this isn submitted one as mine as long as it remains only with a within a few examiners who are unable to find that copy ill get by and they can merely pass away but revive required to publish that em take thesis and make it visible publicly then i may be worry because if not today tomorrow somebody else may certainly jor el who further guess copied from southern salesperson and this effect should be revoked that would act as a deterrent that is the reason why i mentioned even in my presentation that a digital record is permanent then is non refutable a paper record you can do lot of hanky panky and you may not be able to process so my serious suggestion to all our colleagues to their college administration please make it obligatory that every bee take report every emcee a report every am tech report is publicly available it is available in ai debate of course it often it is available as abstracts but some dives the complete dissertation there only one or two situations where the entire thing may not be public and hell tell you those situations a which are exempted even elite hip hop number one if it is a sponsored project where somebody has funded the project and the intellectual property right is shared with that sponsoring organization then those portions of the em take thesis which relate to the protected intellectual property rights are not required to be publisher yet the remaining part is required to be published but let me hasten to tell you that such imtech dissertations are hardly ten per cent of the total lib tech dissertation and at the be level or emcee a level they are hardly any such sponsored a project therefore there is no excuse for anyone to say my project is mine i will not publish a project which has been assessed as a university submission is a public property must be publicly so my sincere suggestively i in fact i will when i will discuss the we are repository i will discuss the space and i will tell you how this can be very easily established open source software available to build that repository and all that you need to do is my dear be tech student my dear emcee a stood my dear emtec student your submitted your thesis but unless you uploaded on this si under certification that this is my im text says you will not get your deal simple and make that visible to everyone thank you very much thank you let me go to the savannah college of ohio i am personally very much thankful for promoting the values that are very much essential require ongoing mass activity of education indiana level sir my query is regarding the term hidden platform that our university has been re assigning or rather make it compulsory for all the enthusiasts however are to be submitted to the university it is not compulsory today check through the turnitin website answer my question is sir that we practice in a way that each of the student is allotted one slot on the website and in the slot the student is advised to check again and again by changing or ab or other updating the same pieces and bring it down to the level of content as permitted by the university nowshera if this document so far it is a thesis document is okay but if the student wishes to change a change the entire file to check some other report and then still the report is not published but i know you will the donated refer to a document which is judged by some other students are within the terminated platform or consider only the publicly disclosed on the web available material only in a good question unfortunately i do not know the correct answer but youre very right if the turnitin is an intelligent but platform it should take every submitted report for checking also as an addition to the corpus but i do not know whether the turnitin platform does it today or not most rally it relies only on the published material but i love to check with my colleague and hell get back to remove most rally i request you to post this question on discussion forum and i or somebody else will respond to it but thank you for raising this point from their previous facebook page discussion that we had and we can we continue the question with that yeshua said it was suggested by the faculty that those students who were attending lip classroom activities basically which are out of class a created and then coming up in the class the in class activity certain incentives can be announced for this event so sir what kind of incentives could be announced except for the arts there are two types of incentives which work best not only with students but even with us grown ups one incentive is of course marco grade which you correctly point out that cannot be provided the other incentive is a financial incentive so for example we can declare an award now where do you give this award from so you may say that you will collect leads a hundred rupee from every student in the class and that becomes your kitty and out of that collection you will reward someone who does in an extraordinary job the second and less expensive mechanism of doing it is public acknowledgement and churubusco the tweance if there are a few students who do an extraordinary job publicize their names not only to the class but to the entire academic community of your department and of your institution believe me most of us are encouraged by public acknowledgement of some good work that weve done we have benefited tremendously by adopting this approach amongst our schools community nighty i see no reason why it will not work with your community in fact there is one additional suggestion that i would make in terms of conducting flipped classroom more easily in institutions which largely run undergraduate program and therefore they do not have teaching assistants in the form of emtecs students amy stools or pdi studio i this is still benefit from the presence of a large number of puzzle stools now let me tell you this notion that teaching assistants must be either postgraduates or pay the student is not entirely correct while we should have such people but in colleges where such senior students or researchers are not available it should be perfectly alright to try another mechanism of getting teaching assistants and that is from our own undergraduate community and let me tell you this is not hypothetical in i te bombay in addition to m taken padi students we ordinarily deploy third year or fourth year we take students as teaching assistants for our core courses that they are selected on the base of applications they want to apply for a bean age and they participate in conducting lab and they participate in conducting flipped classroom session in fact the summer course the time teaching she is one woman i have a forty days from amongst the applicants were all be tech student we take second a third or fourth year student and who work with me to help me conduct this flipped classroom sessions for more effective because as you can guess its a people intensive tasks have to engage with my students in discussion and i cannot do it alone now this has not been tried by most of our colleges namely trying to involve third year and fourth year be tech students as undergraduate years for my coworkers i would strongly suggest that this be encouraged because this has given great positive results they have been situations in eighty bombay where some of the better these are not why im take or pay the student but are the third or fourth year undergraduate student yes somehow the firsty rights relate to them very easily of course this cannot be done for all the undergraduate course particularly when im teaching a third year course then at worst i can take a fourth year undergraduate ridgity in eighty bombay there is an approved procedure of pain a tear shape to such students for the entire semester the amount is not very large but that amount works as an additional incentive for senior be tech students to participate of course there is an extra work that i have to do as a teacher for example at the beginning of the semester i have to conduct a training session for the stage informing them what is flipped classroom and how to run it and then for every week or two weeks or three weeks of portion i have to actually discuss with my students what are the problem that i am going to consider in my flip flops each room and what kind of question students maya but on the whole it has been an extremely pleasant and useful experience prices i take it as the student must be encouraged so we need to point a particular matter to encourage them to get into the circle yes that is what i say thank you thank you andy my mrs usher poor julia over to you or sell in our peer assessment we have been given a column of feedback at the end where we can show that if the people have not worked or given their screen cast and has outsourced the video so in that case all sure how youd like to know can this be a taken by the organisers to find out deeply plagiarism i suppose it can be done however as far as plagiarism for the everyp is concerned we would limit this activity is strictly at the moment two self declaration and self confession and anything else that we would like to do we would do it only at our head i would not like individual remote centers or individual workshop auditors to try and dig deeper into this app please remember what i said the self esteem of everyclick preacher is as important to me as that of my own and we would not like any activity or any public discussion on the matter of how such pleasure wisdom could be detected so i value your suggestion what i would request is that not only you but any other colleagues across the country who have such suggestions please write an individual email to me directly dont write this in discussion forum but write such emails directly to be i will take cognizance of all these emails and will perhaps prepare a consolidated paper on how to deal with such future plagiarism but your suggestion is important i think the point okay thank you sir beside this i would like to keep my opinion that we do we have several techniques like randomization aura by putting up on turn it in awe as okay but its finally to our integrity that we need to watch upon us that what we are preaching we should also tests your hundred percent right there is no mechanism better then the self check in self control that is the reason why everywhere in the world confession is considered an extremely powerful cleansing mechanism for self i may be tempted to make a mistake but probably nobody else will ever be able to catch it only when i can face first to myself and second to summer in confidence saying sorry i made that mistake does not do it that is the correct implementation the well uses tape anything else will not work generically in all cases i agree with you and that is where that is what i meant when i said collectively we need to enhance the value system that prevails amongst us and if we succeed in doing that i am sure will enhance the value system among the students as well but its a long uphill task and were to perpetually keep going is there any more question longwood gardens i want to ask one thing that we are regularly using tourney team or checking the assignment and research paper which were submitting on the website like elsewhere but there we face one problem that the tsa for example i have a previously submitted my research paper and my name institute name also shown in the pleasure island the per cent age goes around twenty to twenty five per cent so can you k can we deal such type of problem while giving the document for turnitin oh yes and no you can simply remove the name of the author and the name of the institution are affiliation and submit that however let me tell you that the percentage that turnin ridden gives needs to be taken with a pinch of salt ordinarily unless the commonality is reported to be more than sixty per cent i would not bother too much so anything between thirty per cent to sixty per cent i would tell my student that look there is some some problem here please go back and cross check yourself but anything which is fifteen percent to twenty percent of course you would be very careful what this percentage is for example if the twenty percent is reported but the entire twenty percent belongs to two or three complete paragraphs outlining the major research findings which have been copied by someone else then i should be based on the head however is if it is because of such similarities that you mention its okay in general then you to take the output of the turnitin in a very in is slightly subjective manner you cannot take it just their quantitative judgement age let let us admit there is no foolproof mechanism of catching copy after all are we able to catch all copying done by our stood xiv examination so it is no different when it comes to results okay okay thank you thank you lets go to the next institution and for conducting a greater credit implement program read moreso be teaching fraternity and get ready benefited a knocker my question is related to the plagiarism i want to write an article or a research paper and i copy i take a few lines on a paragraph from somewhere else and i cite that paragraph now is it considered plagiarized material oh i have taken a reference on i have cited that paragraph or the one thing so let me explain the a view of the academic community if you take a paragraph exactly as is although you cite the referrals you must put the entire paragraph in double quotes that weiss that that will indicate that you have taken the entire paragraph as is without modifying it and then you see then that is not considered plagiarism but that is also not considered very good writing practice so if i have submitted a paper which as such we are four paragraphs copied entirely from some other place and have sight there that this paragraph is for this reference this paragraph is from this referral i will not be accused of plagiarism but the reviewer will prolly throwaway that paper saying that water does not seem to have applied his mind and he has not put the research findings of these four papers in his own words which is what is expected in a good recipe so i hope i am very clear no plagiarism but no value add in the research paper that i suck in general i must learn to put even the sighted thoughts of others in my own word in my own perspective that is what is expected when i submit an said i can take an example of a software engineering the definition of software engg seats are in software engineering applies a correction
