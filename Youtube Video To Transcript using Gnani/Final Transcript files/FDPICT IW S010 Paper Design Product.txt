we can answer only one time reporters two chances we may get high scores other trustworthy are quick about adriana ah but you think in terms of the difficulty level the questions are very very simple recall kind of things if you just observe the video id be right now the reason is last time when we did this for students not for teachers a leg way we do this with students what they do they do it in the group that only four choices my four people sit and guess all the force as if they know what the correct answers so which is the reason there are errors been decided that you keep it at one at a because a very simple its not like vary if we just listen to the video and look at the transcript its more than sufficient to answer most of the crop is thank you thank you out a thank you so this is a behemoth college of engineering bangalore there is no clarity in yesterdays moodle activities that we want to know about that and one more thing is regarding everybodys asking the peer assessment date under those who have not submitted the deadline is over it is not required to give them one more chance because those who made the rapport real effort will be the sufferers i dont think the if the yesterdays the presenter told that will be one more chance for those who are not committed a pious man and those were submitted on time and get the review will not be benefited in this aspect i dont think we should not entertain the portions were not presented on time thank you thank you i will convey your feedback to them normally it is given only once but i think because they are doing it for the first time most of them are not familiar with the sequence of activities involved in peer assessment but will really appreciate your comment and well i respect that sensitivity are normally not be given but just because first time you are doing a appear assessment what can happen as many times they dont look at the example that go directly and so many questions come to us asking which to do first i could not see any screen why am i not able to see and so on i came on twenty fifth the last date i came on twenty fifth but nothing so that it is basically a problem with getting used to the technology and i think once people are familiar it should be okay but definitely even if it is that it will not be there for more than one its the one the first assignment alone i think we will give a little leverage even if they give a submitted the again it is mainly for learning but that not be considered for grading like somebody is allowed to submit the second time but they will not get the grade there lonely be adjust sbiff familiarizing them themselves with the interface is that okay thank you very much so thank you we will start the session for today for about one hour from now we will do what is called as a paper designing of a product i in this case the product is not actually a physical product but a web page okay so beginning tomorrow you will listen lectures on how to design simple web sites for faculty in waterford various tools available on how to go use the stones but before that you need to know why you are designing this product and the how your going to go about it so that is called as a paper design paper design means basically you do everything on paper okay and then later take it on to a software so paper design could be used in many things like if you actually designing a product for example only designing this mouse a you dont start gowan start taking a plastic and starting are starting to mold it so we do a design on paper you see the specification then you a ticket to put some see possible materials easy which is better and so on so that is the first step in a design is a what is called as a paper design here the paper designers to gather what is to be why are doing a particular web site and how do you go about thinking about what to put inside the website oak now todays activity will be too one in the morning an one hour lab session in the afternoon so i hope you all form the groups that you were asked to form a group of two to four with the preferably within your college the same college and identify any one as the team lead so i hope you have done that we will use the same a team for todays exercise so if you are not sitting next to your team i would request that the team members sit next to each other now right now please rearrange your seat so that you sit next to your team members a team of a two to four with a team lead so what we will do is do an example design now today the morning and i will pose a problem to you which you have to work in the afternoon with the same group you might be able to finish it in the afternoon if not you can carried back to your college and since we have asked the team to be from your college you can work with your team and then submit the assignment assignment again here would be whatever you did on a paper you do it on a paper to scan it and then you upload it in mode so that is the a broad structure of todays activity so we will start with a simple problem later in the afternoon and give you a slightly expanded problem based on the simple problem so the problem that we are going to do today is how do you express your research work so you have carried out a particular research work just one piece of research but maybe youre working into a three different areas maybe lets take only one of them and you want to put up information about this on a website how do you do this so that is the problem so there is just one information that you your got to share which is one problem of your research work awesome development work that you carried out you want to put it in the website how do you go about this is the problem we will be addressing as groups and am going to take you through a short presentation as and when i put up the a slide we will carry out an activity around that slide okay and then we will complete by about an hour we should be a able to complete the work later you can download this presentation and carry out the same steps in the afternoon lab session so let us design on a paper how to put up information on a research problem that you are working now so firstly the broad steps we are going to follow is to do it on a paper so this is what we call us thinking before developing you dont actually go and sit with a software tool which gives you a website but you articulate your thoughts on paper individually and then discuss with your peers in this case appears is the group a group of a three to four that a form the team whose current work on this problem each of you will have their own ideas you have to discuss with your peers and then converge on these ideas so this is very similar to your think pair and share so here it is mainly think and share because its a very small team you just going to articulate first and then converge on the ideas the first step in designing a product or in this particular case a simple web page not a whole big website but only a simple web page the first step is to find out who the audience who is going to consume this who is going to make use of it okay so what will do now is each of you take a piece of paper and start writing down roles who are the different roles roles in the sense is a the a general audience whose country is it media whos got a view the webpage is going to be a student is your current student is a past student future student is at your department peers is a term a people from the journalism or media or is it going to be the ministry or is it going to be some potential employer who is going to look at your web page who is it okay so by role i mean you have to identify a particular set of people so you just list all the roles that are possible all the rules who is likely to consume this piece of information so please take your a pen and paper and start writing down names individually without discussing with others i will give you about five minutes time and then i will let you raise hands and then we will do the second step which is calling out all possible roles so will take about five minutes time now okay so i will ask you to raise hands if youre ready i see only five hands rise wrzesnia keep your rolls ready am just going to ask for just one or two roles for a college so we have dronacharya said we are heading it is to have toured a appear for your interviews have to answer the question who is the target audience is finally a students of professional courses job applicants and people were preparing for the jobs let me repeat the question again in the morning session we are doing a simple problem the problem is your working on research area okay it is just one page of information on a particular research problem that you are working on it is about your research problem it is not about institute its not about job applicants nothing it is just your research problem you have in mind you want to put it out to the world now the questioners who are the potential audience of your research problem thats all you please answer that question as a list of people who are potential audience i said that the target audience we should identify so thats what i was trying to find out that for this is such problem the targeters deals maybe students and job application maybe not very clear about the idea tell so maybe we can see other participation then we clean or okay so your saying let me just write down your saying job applicants okay okay lets go to the next college is deum institute we have identified your the rules a students mainly when colleagues then management people industry people okay thats an orgasm i just take it down edens colleagues management people okay thats fine thank you very much savageness and college of engineering my research indicates her identified students in category of aegean edie yes these scholars teachers on where one can in similar area please hold on i am writing it down uci students pg students and then each day scholars okay then appears here are the teachers who are working in similar area of a discipline a campaign to reset the hand raises now and am going to ask a different question you have to raise your hands only if you got any other roles other than what is listed here let me take guitars university hyderabad so doctors biomedical technician biomedical technicians oh yes thank you matthew algo to cases of vienna and deeper rising annie my research area is cheer synthetics yes fear synthetics are used for rule railway and many other applications so the user industry would be a manufacturing industry one minute place then configure dont give a very general manufacturing industries that well who in manufacturing industries will up give up i want a role user design section designers in fact okay and yes then what else users are government bodies and ministries engineers in municipal corporation boring thank your decision maker those were the same exhaust on example engineers a hormone incipal operations of thats enough we are just doing an examples of what im trying to do is not exactly solve the problem now cannot be cannot solve the problem immediately so all these roles that we have identified are people people like you and me okay ultimately were going to interact with people we are going to help people or we are going to seek some information from them should some interaction with people so please identify the people who are the people dont identify organization so the way i try to get answers from you when you do this as a team youre going to do the work as a theme for a homework problem which is the afternoon if your teammate is posing generic things like government organizations or say that municipality that is not an audience okay that is a non living object we are not talking about that we are talking about people so try to identify who this particular community of people are who want this information that is very very important okay so very good now a broadly a got the first step you do is to identify all this potential people and then the next step is to consolidate them so what we did was buy identified roles we called out all possible things although i dont have time to do for everybody but just as an example so we are called out all possible roles now the next step is to consolidate and under various groups so what do we do now you can organize them under various groups maybe all the students category can be in one group teachers spears can colleagues can be in another group professionals like doctors biomedical and manufacturing all these things under another group so broadly if you say there are three groups that has emerged from whatever we have got so we have students peers professionals so weve got students peers and professional so we have consolidated all these things under various groups so identify roles call them out consolidate under various groups so we have identified the audience escort the next step now you have identified these groups the next question you ask us what are their goals what is it that each of this role or reach of this group of people want to achieve one to achieve not in general of course they wont achieve several things in life not that what we talking about is what they want to achieve with something that you have essentially a web page is a way to communicate what you have what you can provide or what you are seeking for basically it is what you have or what you want to get in this case you have something you have something that you can provide it does in this particular case it is a research thing which you have carried out and which you have knowledge now this knowledge in the context of the broad thinks that the user group wants to achieve how what is their goal in using this particular knowledge that you have so take another five minutes an individually identify for each of these group of students what do they want to achieve with the information that you have students peers and professionals so take this and see what do they want to achieve with the particular information that gavin this case the particular information is not a general website of institute it is not a general website of a department it is not your own general website but a specific research problem that you have personally you the named person has got a research problem how what are the goals of these people by using this water theyre trying to achieve okay so what are the goals so take five minutes and write down what are the goals of this individuals okay so i will take quickly yes i think my students can be a new dimension for their projects are expanding their knowledge be okay so they want to earn a no more than something related to their project that is the objective of the students again thank you very much with these ideas they can enhance their future research soap okay fine federal institute of science and the point of hidden taken into the knowledge by viewing your apart from that a thats already been suggested can you include any new points ethiopia therapy and yoga that malik insole input on their part to the ticketing okay so they can not comment on your work okay thank you very much algo to another institute thank you very much government engineering college let me share a room on gozo professions agility he earned the benefit on a ghost would be like developing the entire bar research domain and developing the india raccoons nor further upgradation are related to the outputs and here basically they would act as a diploma and ma at the same time they would give monitor trainer program and according to the output according to the outcome they would further like deploy next course of action this is for professionals you are asking you are suggesting that professionals that you have who use your information i will actually develop it into a product you have a basic research they proudly development into a product or something usually of marketing yes okay thank you very much thank you savageness college roles of the piers there will be probably exploring the website in a case if they are looking for a summer read designee or exploring the past efforts to a relative who they are another set of results maybe looking for some a specific solution for a particular case study in a case of a professional they may be looking for getting reference for patent search activity of a very good thank you so up i thanked all of your broadly got the ideas of others in the second step we look at what do each of them have as goals from something that you have so you just list down for ease of this role so we had a three broad roles and within each broad role you had a some sub roles like peachy student eugene student appears the scholars and so on now for each of them you have to list down a set of goals after you do that you have to prioritize which is the most important thing in each group what is the most important goal for each of them because you will be designing a website which addresses their primary goal you they will have thousand different things thousand different uses of the information you provide what is the highest priority goal for that each particular user so that is what he called us prioritizing the goals so you can do that i will not go through that now lets go to the next step this is the one of the most important thing to understand the current problems what are the problems that each of these people you have identified your identified that they have a particular goal now what does the current pain points pain points meaning what are the problems that theyre facing now before your website is up in accessing this information or using this information currently lets say you dont have a website of which says your research problem but it it is there in some other form so these people whom your identified have a certain goal they want to achieve it either they dont have access to the information that you have or they have the access to it but theyre not able to use it effectively so there is some pain point there some problem that theyre facing in accessing that information so it is very important to understand these pain points and then what you present will actually address these pain points unless you address these pain points you have not achieved your goal of providing information in a useful form otherwise it simply amounts to putting something on the web always we need to think of people thats why i said at the beginning we have to think of people who are these people not organizations not general a bodies but people in those organisations people in those bodies what is it that they want to achieve your identified that but in the process of achieving that theyre facing some difficulties can you make it something easy for them to achieve their goal from what you have so thin but the next five minutes and list down what are the current pain points that this group of people have uses identify one or two and list them down as the difficulties they they may be potent either you know is that theyre facing or you can put yourself in that position and say okay potentially this is what they may face so please write it down as what are the pain points that are currently faced by this audience again you can write it down as a table something like this i will share in the screen so i hope you can see this for each role you can create a table like a spreadsheet each role you have a goal but in achieving that goal there is a problem which is a pain point with some difficulty that theyre facing it may also call it as so created table roll goal and pinpoint so as part of your assignments that will be doing you have to do this as one of the submissions one page containing role which is the first thing weve identified the second thing that we identified goal and the pain points so im going to reset the hand races again so let us take one or two quick pinpoint suggestions okay let us go to walton solapur set the rule is too dark they goalies uptake knowledge or use the current research for the base for their research and the difficulties that the pace is they may not get clear idea about to research just by reading it or they may not understand how this research work stood out better from the others thats fine thats good thing so theyre not able to let say you had met the student once and you explained but since it is not put in some a written form they not able to understand its okay thank you very much welcome the next college kelly institute wrote referring to the professional arm and goal is basically a view to be such a indian pee and pinpoint the limited information on the theory behind research topic may require more peeps are in between a modern tourist in are we said okay let me just elaborate that point so she has taken a professionals as the role and they want to use this to develop something but since the maybe the paper there was a paper a which was too abstract for a developer there particularly want to look for some case studies so that it is a more easy for them to understand now case studies are not available anywhere and therefore theyre not able to use your results so very good so youre clearly said a a important pain point thank you very much i will go to raw omega institute of technology next year some are pain points for rules student police to gain knowledge and pinpoint is lack of guidance and is misconception may continue okay thank you very much arti patel the hash then begins to shine we can answer only one time reporters two chances we may get high scores other trustworthy are quick about adriana ah but you think in terms of the difficulty level the questions are very very simple recall kind of things if you just observe the video id be right now the reason is last time when we did this for students not for teachers a leg way we do this with students what they do they do it in the group that only four choices my four people sit and guess all the force as if they know what the correct answers so which is the reason there are errors been decided that you keep it at one at a because a very simple its not like vary if we just listen to the video and look at the transcript its more than sufficient to answer most of the crop is thank you thank you out a thank you so this is a behemoth college of engineering bangalore there is no clarity in yesterdays moodle activities that we want to know about that and one more thing is regarding everybodys asking the peer assessment date under those who have not submitted the deadline is over it is not required to give them one more chance because those who made the rapport real effort will be the sufferers i dont think the if the yesterdays the presenter told that will be one more chance for those who are not committed a pious man and those were submitted on time and get the review will not be benefited in this aspect i dont think we should not entertain the portions were not presented on time thank you thank you i will convey your feedback to them normally it is given only once but i think because they are doing it for the first time most of them are not familiar with the sequence of activities involved in peer assessment but will really appreciate your comment and well i respect that sensitivity are normally not be given but just because first time you are doing a appear assessment what can happen as many times they dont look at the example that go directly and so many questions come to us asking which to do first i could not see any screen why am i not able to see and so on i came on twenty fifth the last date i came on twenty fifth but nothing so that it is basically a problem with getting used to the technology and i think once people are familiar it should be okay but definitely even if it is that it will not be there for more than one its the one the first assignment alone i think we will give a little leverage even if they give a submitted the again it is mainly for learning but that not be considered for grading like somebody is allowed to submit the second time but they will not get the grade there lonely be adjust sbiff familiarizing them themselves with the interface is that okay thank you very much so thank you we will start the session for today for about one hour from now we will do what is called as a paper designing of a product i in this case
