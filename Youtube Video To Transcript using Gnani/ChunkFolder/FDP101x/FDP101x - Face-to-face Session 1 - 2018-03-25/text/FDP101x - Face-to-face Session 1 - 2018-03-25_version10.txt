in one level on top of it but can we mention darkly mention questions in blog with multiple choice questions archive one three six four one to know how to take a create everyday so that they can take feedback from the learners and in fact a very good question from arci one one four zero so the question is is it not if everyone follow the same procedure then we will end up with killing creativity it is correct so the question is if i give standard instructions for all wouldnt everyone do it similarly and we would have any diverse answers or diverse solutions coming from the participants so the answer is yes and no yes because as if it is like up its like we we are not doing an assembly line a process now each one of you would do something very differently and as an instructor you have to be very careful as to how much your gig going to give details and how much you are going to leave it open and now are many people feel that suits students many teachers so this is a regular complaint that i receive from a teachers when they talk about their foods todays students require a require us to us to spoon feed them when they want all the answers they want all these things in detail given to them so there is there is truth in having some structure and there is also the a need for it to be sufficiently open ended specifically in higher education in the higher education a sector that is the only place where students are now being forced to think out of the box or are they get the opportunity to be more creative a bits they are learning how it should have been done right from their schooling where they should have had more of such collaborative activities more of these project activities more of these application activities but unfortunately many schools or many systems are not unable to do it and we are trying as teachers we are trying to ensure that you a the a teachers get empowered as prose of attack said we are not limiting to injuring a be our wish is not to limit it at engineering education alone even more teachers to benefit from these kind of activities and hence it is important that as teachers you also get a flavour of what it is to have open ended activities now there was some sufficient structure the structure was that each of you had to create wordpress webpage both individually and as a nazi and you had to share the artsy webpage in the google docs now this is the structure that we give and we had left how you do this creation of a pagan and a given olive berry a top level instruction on what the web page should contain the actual activity was to be done by the aussie and the individual so we had given sufficient room for creativity up within the answers but some amount of structure because without structure just giving living an activity to be opened
