provide what kind of feedback are you going to give the students it should be a constructive fid it should be telling them how to move ahead from where they were to what they had to do so adjust up over here i am at the start of the session i told you all of you had done different plans of action i showed you what the plan of action men and i showed you an example of a how you can actually translated so this is exactly what we intend from doing so first is that whatever you learned in the prior two weeks use the interaction session to apply it along with your peers that is the primary aim of the abuses you should apply along with peers so that you get feedback from peers and the purpose of the instructors at the end of the activity provide you a more generic feedback so that you can improve it the next time now as a nazi what you had to do was ensure that you bring all these together again as an archive also you did the same activity so you created a wordpress web page you created the three different items but what was more important was there was something more so there was an unsupervised question where you had to create a plan of action and all we had asked viewers steps to be done at an artsy to disseminate whatever you have created now this is more at a create level in a revised blooms taxonomy so you had to think what alt steps i will take you had to think how will i so i now that ive created a web page how should i now go ahead and disseminated and for this you had to discuss again with your peers like what all could be the pros and cons now what woodwork suppose i do this how much it will show you have to evaluate each of your plans and finally come up with a consolidated plan so you do analysis you do evaluation and finally you do a creation or synthesis activity and this is exactly what you should be doing in your own classrooms and we have the power of technology to enable or help you out in this activity so i hope all of you would now be thinking about what did you do yesterday what was intended where am i lacking or where did i go wrong what all should have improved where all should i have given my own individual are what is a higher order thinking abilities too a executed more effectively so ah there is an interesting question that is coming from archie one four one one arm so the army is asking a in chad to do analysis or discussion all the fellow participants need to be conversant with it is it not so ah yes so the answer is both a yes and no yes because
