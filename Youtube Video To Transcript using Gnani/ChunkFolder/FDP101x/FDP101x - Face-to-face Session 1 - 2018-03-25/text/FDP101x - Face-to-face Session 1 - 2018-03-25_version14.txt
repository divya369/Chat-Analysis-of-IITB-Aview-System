i am trying to upload it in wordpress in the wordpress dot com domain there are some restrictions to the size you can have only up to a three gibby size as of now sophia simulations and animations are arm be above the adat size limit will not be able to upload eden sizes restriction yes oh yes so a nextas arcy one zero six three ah daiji patil college of engineering and technology pimpri a halo halo man guided much a good morning myself misses magura bikini from imight academy of engineering pune grazed my questionnaire in wordpress a we are giving the questions which are the multiple choice questions yes yes to kistler disney pushes are stewart insists so and when the students are giving answers to this shot and sees how to evaluation because everyone giving the shortened season different a week and lindy are lindy answers the how to evaluate the url in the questions are short answer questions okay so the question that has been asked a by myra mam from ma why every man from arci one one zero six three i think i had seen the same question from several other participants file do a general a response with the question was how to give a questions and answers which are in descriptive in nature so multiple choice questions can be enabled through multiple ways like a you could embed a google form or you could actually ask the question with the options in text format within the wordpress and phpbb but they are in engineering i read specifically you need open ended answers short answers etc how to do those using wordpress now the answer to this is wordpress is a content management system it is not a learning management system and what your trying to do or the learning activities of the learning activities to be present in a content management system you need to check whether there are plugins available for these kinds of activities of this would convert a content management system to be a learning management system now in the upcoming week we are going to discuss learning management systems in detail but for each technology see the a top level a thing is that each technology has a purpose and the purpose of a technology like wordpress is to gather content and disseminated more effectively or it that is why it is called a content management system so the purpose of content management system is too a you should understand what this technology is useful for an use it for that purpose primarily this is where its effectiveness increases now aview is a virtual classroom software now within this virtual classroom you could do document sharing you could share animations you could do a chat you could ask queries henrys etc but you cannot do a large scale evaluation using a bow because this software is not meant for that you cannot have individual participant come in and right answers and a teacher sit here and give marks directly through ebay they are there is no back and where they store marks they display the grades to the students etc so each technology has a primary purpose for which it has been built and when you look at these technologies you should actually a identify what the primary purposes and use it for the primary purpose alone
