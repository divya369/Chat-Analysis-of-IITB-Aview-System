so far we have therefore a serious pub or do we do to ensure that the relevant information about the content which are there inside that file is available in some form preferably in a standardized form unfortunately there is no mechanism there is no standardization for the names that you use for the fire although the extension may be standard we need to you all therefore some standardization of names that we use at least in our local animal so if i am going to ask my students to submit some assignment online then i must invariably give a nomenclature pattern to be used by all students so that not only the filename conveys that this is a site meant to be submitted in april to thousand team but it also tells me about the roll number or name of that student if they stood belongs to a particular laboratory batch in the batch number etc you will find that in most of the submissions that you have to make in this course such nomenclature standardization will be given time will tell you please prepare a figh appeared a file or whatever file and ensure that the name of that file is like this these days it should contain this it should contain this it should can tell you now understand why we insist on such a thing because we have more than three thousand participants in this course and if all three thousand participants upload a file called assignment one dot pda you can see the problems that our teaching assistants would have and you can see the problem that you will have if you get exactly such submissions from your stools late so please not only spend some time in understanding how such nomenclature can be given but ensure that in all your assignments where you ask your students in future to summit anything online such instructions are clearly given i was telling you about the fact that independent how cleverly we decide on the name of a file it is impossible to reflect every relevant information about the content of that file in that name let me give an example last year we were creating a site for eminent personalities this was part of a project under the national virtual library of india mission that we are engaged them jointly with scidac enigma we are creating a very very large cloud in which all the digital assets representing the knowledge and cultural heritage information about the country will be accumulated over the coming years we have created a cloud with a storage capacity usable storage capacity of greater than three petabytes petabyte is another thing i do not know how many of your familiar with the terminology used to describe the storage you prolly all know that the files have a size associated with them and typically wherever you look at a directory you will see the file names you see other information like when the file was created whatever but you also see the size of the five typically it is given in kilobytes or megabyte for example a digital photograph is typically two to fe four megabytes large in contain a high quality high resolution photograph of course when you want to send such photographs as attach better your file you would like to have a slightly reduced pill pillow so you like to have the size of your image file in kilobytes there are tools which will do that
