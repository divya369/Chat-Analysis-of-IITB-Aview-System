and submitted this is an opportunity friends to learn more about how such things are done elsewhere and how we ought to do this one of the exercises that i will create a write up and give it to you is to indicate these aspects in brief that have discussed and give you an exercise to choose proper filenames and extensions or some simple documents and photographs that i will indicate and each one of you will have to choose a name in the group activity it would be nice if all of you can do this by tomorrow morning because i will compose this submitted her put it up tonight it will be nice if they just spent five minutes discussing with some of your colleague as to what are the names chosen by him or her other name chosen by me and enhance your understanding on how better names can be chewed i conclude this session on what is there in a name and say that there will be certain exercise that all of you will have to do jail compose tonight i would like to use now this opportunity to interact with some of the remote centers on students or a jayakrishnan tells me that the every year as you know we keep making modifications to the style of our every ppi to bring in the better practices i already told you about how several mentors have emerged out of top performing participants of the previous every piece this year we started something new one of our remote centers which participated in the last evthe i believe it is a cokehead its sorry its a new remote center and in that remote center they realize that there would be technical issues that they will have to solve concerning these aview interaction as you know your institute that remote center must have a internet bandwidth which is adequate in addition it must have a prk which loads the software which is on the client side of eve then there are so many settings to be done to connect it to speaker microphone etc and finally there has to be a link established between the eave you serve and their place in most of our remote centers by the way they are competent technical staff who handle this thing we teachers often do not understand the tremendous value of such technical staff and the technical support that they bring to bear on us in fact if all of you are able to see me and listen to me it is primarily because the technical staff members in all these remote centers are doing their job perfectly we depend so much on them i would also add that because we do we should also learn to humbly respect them for what they do and to acknowledge it at least once in awhile traditionally in academic institutions it is not a common practice for the faculty members to acknowledge the work that is done by the technical staff men although all of us understand that our lives depend on them so this is an opportunity i would like to take to thank all the technical staff members in various remote centers who facilitate this interaction i come back to the point in the report centre in kochi
