here is a simple arithmetic we have now four hundred sixty report said one fourth of these undead in pretty remote centers decide to become local hubs and connect to hundred institutions realize how many institutions you will reach out to and if you can use the ready made content that will be made available in open source by us by others you can use open source contents available from any source and plus you can actually create your own additional educational content please understand that creating a video lecture snippet is not as difficult that used to be in old days you can sit in front of your laptop or desktop have a webcam i have a good microphone and believe me you can record a very good five minute seven minute session in your own domain in your own language for example if you are in chhattisgarh in door and if you are trying to address the higher secondary teachers majority of these higher secondary teachers or temporal standard teachers might be teaching their suits in hindi and they might have studied only in hindi whatever material that you pick up from mighty bombay which is in english may not be directly useful what prevents you from actually because all of these are open source resources what prevents you from taking this creating it in there and actually conducting training programs for teachers in hindi we can all do that that is what i would encourage you ha ha he saying that in last year safety ppi the participating teachers had created webpages in their own language for example manipuri and sworn a video video theyve created a video on how to create a wordpress web pages so is that video available but why is it not made park that link is not made part of the iriver makes ice so that link is available you may perhaps use it right any closing comments over to you we also foresee to fulfill your dream of becoming one of the local hubs where you send thank you very much thank you very much have we still have about seven minutes we can go to couple of other remote centers published this week which governing said good morning america good morning happy to see you yes amps with a remote center chordata agility workshop connie it is a hobby and even participants wow i am active in pads and even less reliable than one participant wants to communicate with users she has done a very good morning you are my name is pallavi mahagun am from a mighty college first of all i would like to thank all your team members and efforts what you are taking for taking this if deepy and developing some ai see te a teaching learning process so am very much excited with this course and whatever activities we i have done in this two weeks i learn a mini things answer thank you very much one incident i would like to share with you a one day i was giving question to myself
