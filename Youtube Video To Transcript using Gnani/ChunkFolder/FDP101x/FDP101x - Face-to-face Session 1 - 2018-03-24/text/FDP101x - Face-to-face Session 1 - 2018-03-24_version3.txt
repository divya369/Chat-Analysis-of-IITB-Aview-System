which describes more than six hundreds standard exchange not all of them are required and were most certainly not expected to remember all of them but the major file formats which are typically used for educational purposes must be understood by us like that its time for a rest email five dot jpg for an image file dot pedi if as i already mentioned not dock as already mentioned some of these formats and some of the nomenclature for the extinction determining the format of data in that file must be easily remembered by most of us whenever we are trying to use icity for effective education i spoke about the extension but there is a name of a file which were to choose and give whenever we create a file we send files as attachments this could be text files or dirty ext extinction as is the standard nomenclature or this could be image files this could be photographed i this could be video file they remember the video file extension those of you played videos will know that typically the videos will end with dot ebefore okay which is one of the standard formats for video file but anyway i digress i come back the first part of the name which is the actual name that is given to the far do we choose an arbitrary name it is not uncommon to find names like one to three faa dot da what does that team can beat was absolutely nothing would we lie our own names to be like that judges judged for that what would it mean to you deepak fatigue is a better name because deepak the worthy pack has a meaning in indian in the land armor at hiland similarly whenever we decide to choose a filename we shall apply your mind to say that the file name that we choose reflects at least some information or some indication of what that file contains unfortunately this is not done this appears to be very simple thing and that is because most of us do not create many flies in general and those of us who do create files occasionally often use tools which automatically gives some default theme to the fight and we forget that this name will not can be anything to people who actually are going to use this form i give a simple example we are all familiar with scanning of documents so you do you scan documents using a scanner there is usually a scanning utility which comes along with every scanner these days printers their laser printers offer burke scanners as well and it is common to scan a handwritten pages or site pages or signed documents or any document and create a scant five but what happens in very evaluate many of you who have actually done some scanning will know that these scanning utilities will automatically give a default name to the file so scared they will surely ask you in what format you want to save the information typical information saving can be done either in bitmap files are in jpg files or in one of the standard other formats jpg or jpeg is a very well known standard for storing scanned images just as it is a well known standard for storing digital photographs i came back to scanning whenever you scan a document the utility will automatically ask you whether you want to save that file of course you want to save that file so it will say where do you want to save you will save it in something called a folder or a directory on the computer i came back to the folders and directories later but jones
