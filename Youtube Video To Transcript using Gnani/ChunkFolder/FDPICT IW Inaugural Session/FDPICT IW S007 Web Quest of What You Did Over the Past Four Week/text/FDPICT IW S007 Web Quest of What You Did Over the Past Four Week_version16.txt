how to create the activity so you dont have to give the constructor to the students you just have to create the activity and ask them to carry it out so students need not be shown any constructors or any rubrics are anything they have to just simply do the activities that you have created for them so they have to watch the out of class video there to come in class there to do the tips or the peer instruction whatever is the activity the constructor is merely an aid for you to create the activity we there is no need to ask students to create such activities okay anomymous morning sir i am from i see one one zero three to the point and my question theoretical subject red eye exam is focused on the lower cognitive skills such as apply understand and recall how to justify the higher cognitive skills activities of evaluate analyze and create soap a depends upon where the exam is no if you have some control on the internal assessment that is where you can utilize this is the main thing is that students have to understand the benefit of these higher cognitive level activity so that if youre able to communicate to the students then irrespective of whether it is there in the exam or is not there in the exam they will still cooperate with you but if you dont have any control over the exam and if it is just organized by somebody else and theyre all full of recall understand level questions then there is really not much you can do about it okay i will be taking the final two questions because at the session is about to end and then will are also a discuss about the grading strategy for the first four we will explain the marking scheme o archive one zero eight two to the pan instead of technology and management yes this is related to resource creation assigning to a winner i am seeing them a performance of the league in assists fears it was us that we should do minimum poor assessment and where i have done six essays assessments but still there is a red cross and i am not able to understand why the red cross there and i have submitted the sign before deadline ah so this is a common query every person in the model would be seeing a red cross in the assessment phase this is the soldier setting or in models it just says that you have and assist all the assessments that were given to you but at the back and we are ensuring that we have given you the advice that you have to access only four so if you are submitting four please do not worry about the red cross that comes in the assessment phase it is perfectly valid but if your not a beer checking that at the basket so do not worry about the red cross kitchen second question is that enriches creation assignment try again the again having the same query that it was asked to review your assessments and a twenty four were given and i did four but then the dotted line is there its not a complete line that which is a visual whichwill ensure me that i have completed the required tasks no by the dotted line do i have completed four assessments so the dotted line is because you have not assessed the twenty four of the csu moodle sees that you were given a bucket of twenty four in the bucket were gone twenty four and you have taken only four out of it although model does not clearly understand that these were mandated by the workshop team that you need to do only four now this is a small model bug which the other team was trying to so as have already told this assess assigning of a more is a is perfectly valid because it gives you more exposure but you have to do only four
