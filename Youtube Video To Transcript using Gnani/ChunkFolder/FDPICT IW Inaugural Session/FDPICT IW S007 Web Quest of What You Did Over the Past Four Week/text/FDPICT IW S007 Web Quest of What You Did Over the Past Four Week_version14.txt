i am also the assessment of these will not be possible to typically you get zero marks for this submission but it will also ensure that you are eligible for the certificate it will make you eligible for certification if you post it in the course portfolio page problem is that we can submit it on the whole portfolio exactly exactly what was a swing will not be the submissions will not be so whatever is the submission will just see whether you have submitted all the relevant submissions for the afc a these will not be assessed this is just to ensure that you have created all those activities but again these will be checked for plagiarism and if we find plagiarism the addy a action make for the plagiarism will be detail by prosafe protect mode bears him college of engineering the i think the question i didnt catch it fully but the question was how learning is possible while we are evaluating our peers so were like i mentioned the sometime in the beginning there are two types of learning that is happening one is the feedback that you get from others so that is its that thats like the standard evaluation where you get a mark from the teacher and you know get comments on the teacher about what you can improve the other one is when youre the teacher and when youre the evaluator so what happens is that since you are also in the same domain and youre also teaching similar topics this peer assessment the learning that happens is you you get a lot of ideas so you get ideas on okay i can do a tips like this also i can modify some activity in this manner i can create a screencast in this manner so these are the kind of ideas that you get when you are looking at other peoples submissions and also you are always crosschecking somebody submissions without detailed rubric are which has characteristics of target performance so you always evaluate the submission against this target performance and this becomes a learning for you my question is regarding the greedy fat migrates to the crazy something which is theoretically based whereas when we write assignments it something that is based on creativity and innovation classes sunlight easily seen that assessment criteria should be changed where pieces can be considered theoretical level and are degraded in a much better way okay the point is taken that assessments can improve but a yes we are addressing the question so we have three mechanisms of fab a what you said assessments in this particular first four weeks post further knowledge quizzes which actually looked at the theoretical concepts that you learnt then there was a reflection quiz which was about the participation that happened in the discussion forum should a did you go and check the discussion forums so as to encourage what is happening are within the community and a third one the resource creation assessment is actually about the creativity the rubrics if it is very open ended and we have actually tried to address it through rubrics rubrics give some details and there is some subjectivity in assessment and we have provided it does peer assessment a practice so let me take a couple of queries
