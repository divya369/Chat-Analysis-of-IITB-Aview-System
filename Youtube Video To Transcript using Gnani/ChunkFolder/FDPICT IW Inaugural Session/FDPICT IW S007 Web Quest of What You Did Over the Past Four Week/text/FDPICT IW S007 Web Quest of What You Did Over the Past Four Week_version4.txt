this resource for any of us to use in our classrooms so now one way of one important thing of getting this resource created at a fairly high quality level is the peer assessment issue now why so what we have seen is that some people have taken the peer assessment seriously both in terms of submitting the assignment as well as in terms of giving feedback to their peers whereas others have kind of just done it because it is part of the requirement and so on so what i would like to mention here is peer assessment is not just a duty that we perform case not simply because we have set it up and no we dont have that ace to go through all the assignments and give feedback so what they are two things that happen during peer assessment a one is you are giving useful feedback to your peer so that feedback is definitely useful but what do you get out of it why should you bother let the fear worry about their submission themselves why should you take the trouble so the answer to that is that when you take the trouble to go through what your peers have done your learning also improves so this is a strategy that we have used even in undergraduate classrooms we have had students evaluate each others papers okay and what happens the feedback invariably has been is that i have learned something by seeing the other persons answer so either i have learned something new or have got a new idea or i have learnt what should be done and saw isaac students invariably in the beginning they always feel that this peer assessment is a chore and not something to be done seriously but then once they get the hang of it they realize that a lot of learning happens during the assessment itself that is one a difference between the safety and others that you may have undergone in many courses the purpose of assessment is to grade is to award a grade to the lirr okay whereas in our course the purpose of assessment is also learning the purpose of assessment is not grading but the purpose of assessment is learning so when youre assessing your pier the more seriously you look at the submission made by the pier and the more critically evaluated based on the rubrics that are given the more your own learning increases and your feedback also becomes useful to the person whos a submission your evaluating so theyre learning also increases so peer assessment dont think of peer assessment as an evaluation technique by which somebodys given some marks peer assessment is actually a learning technique by which both the person were submitted and the person was assessed or who is assessing both of them get to learn something in the process and this is known to be a effective way of learning rather than the instructor simply ino giving feedback or tears looking at it and giving feedback so that is a reason why we have so much emphasis on peer assessment in this course and why we need you to take the peer assessment phase fairly seriously so with that i think we dont have anything more to say from our end so we will go into the interaction face so if they are if anybody has questions please feel free to do a hand race so just in case a pub sub towards the end of the interaction will be detailing out be a marking schemes so we have received a lot of query so some of the commonly asked questions how does peer assessment is how i have had problems with peer assessment so one part part of it has already been addressed right now the other major queries regarding the grading mechanisms for the first component that is the effectiveness the pedagogy of integrating arm i sit in classrooms will be
