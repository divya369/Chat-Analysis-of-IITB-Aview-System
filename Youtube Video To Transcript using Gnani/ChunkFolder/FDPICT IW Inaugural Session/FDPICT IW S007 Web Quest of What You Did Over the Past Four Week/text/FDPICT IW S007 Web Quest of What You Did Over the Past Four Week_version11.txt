as something most processing of the video must be done so that requires manpower just no not alone a faculty can make an interactive screen cuz video and minutes it will given efficient debt will deliver an efficient concept to the students so i think that if you want to implement out of the class activity much more than they must be an increase the manpower regarding the post processing of the screencast videos a yes so were the at a broad level yes your right that if we want to create this it is going to take effort so it takes effort on the part of the faculty also too because you have to now change the style of a talking and i know you can talk the way you would normally talk in the classroom and its useful to have some other post processing to make the video effective however what we have to keep in mind is that what you are creating screencasts is not for a purely online course no its only when you are going to do a purely online course we need that level of fidelity in the video itself since you are going to augment this with an inclass activity the right now let us just have the goal of no doing basic information transmission in the screencast video so that the background material which the students are supposed to know before they come to class that material is covered so what your saying all of it is valid if we want the student to learn piano mostly through the screen cast itself whereas here what you are attempting is to make the student learn some part through the screen cast the background material and then when they come and do the in class activities in your presence that is when the maximum part of the learning is happening so this exercise of albino having oppose production team which will create the video anol now that its it depends upon whether it is available whether the resources are available they cannot be made available centrally so depending upon the attention you can decide to what extent so it is i know its a challenge for the instructor to decide what to do in the screencast which is effective at the same time which is not very time consuming for them so other detailing that we must deliver in the screencast video minister details the amount of details that you hit deliver so it should be that so much in details because they will be an overall summary and then in the class we will do the detailing of that topics episode i generally thats a good idea in the sense that dino you introduce the topic the screencast video and you create activities which will help the student to do the detailing see the idea is that you should reduce the amount of work that you do in the class on the board so whatever you would have done on the board some of it goes into the screencast and some of it goes as activities where the students were watch the screencast there comment derive the subsequent steps and youre there facilitating the process of their learning so you are right okay national institute of technology i would like to see what do you think about peoples outside the class okay ha ha its a valid question are there are mechanisms are also people have adopted are different technologies to use think pair share outside classrooms for example wikis have been used but there are individual pair a individual pages there is a collaborative page and finally there are entire thing as visible as a common are edited page somebody had used google drive are to do this process there are also what is hip or other technology tools like patlite etc which facilitate these kind of online no arm outside the classroom and online purely online mode of think pair share
