which are there in the chat window there is one query from sardar patel institute of technology and theory which says no we generally use blooms taxonomy but the coaps model is advance compared to blooms taxonomy eyes the kolbs model difficult to implement so actually there are many models its not just a blooms and colds are just two of them and you know we have pick blooms taxonomy because it is very widely used and it is sufficient for our purposes so that is the main reason that we are going with the new revised blooms taxonomy you you are free to implement any other model also as per you know what works well for your class a case there is a question stab which says some of our participants are not able to submit the archies okay this is again so people were not able to submit any assignment make sure that you submitted as part of the course portfolio are unfortunately we wont be able to assess or evaluate them but it will ensure that you have provided all submissions as mandated in the grading policy there are couple of more such questions like couple of participants have missed the first week of the face to face session are eligible to attend the rest of the sessions and complete the course so are participants were missed face to face session so beat the first one or the current one please make sure that you send out an detailed email to e outreach team who are coordinating with the a in this workshop and get the feedback from them so theyll be providing you details on what to do and what happens in case you have missed a session so typically these face to face sessions are for interactions not this interaction with the instructor but interaction among your arses so make sure that the interaction happens and we have the videos of these office to face interaction sessions uploaded in the iati bombacks platform to make a you go through it and do all the activities that are there in those sessions okay going back to the interaction a polarity college my question is regarding peer assessment activity the assessment list in mind some of the activities are listed which are not belongs to my domain like mathematics physics he also as far as possible we have tried to ensure that participants from the same domain get submissions from the others through the group choice so it may have happened that other people who have submitted a wrong submissions they would have selected are wrong group to join so that might be the reason that is why you are getting this so one possible way to ensure that they get a job if you have a do not have sufficient assessment and you are forced to do these assessments then kindly take the help of the community who are from this particular domain either in your college or through the itee bombax platform get in touch with people who are in this particular domains are to check for the validity of the submissions i would advise you if you have more assessments with soap a typically you have sixteen seventeen assignments per are resource creation so as far as possible try to stick to your domain so that you can give an honest feedback about the activities loki marathwada institute of technology i my question is are whatever we are learning now it is just offline without student and actually in one semester will start you want to implement easy classes so when we want to go for out of class activity whether we have to give a constructor or in other forms to the students work these activities so the purpose of the constructor is to help you
