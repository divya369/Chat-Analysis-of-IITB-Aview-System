the inspector the havoc this question is related to the cognitive levels so now i am representing a polytechnique my faculties in the from a polytechnic so it is generally understood that while a teaching technique the students are required to reach the applie level the recall understanding and apply level and normally we do not go beyond that the analysis level recall amin evaluation level and the creative level because they say a tsa students are supposed to be trained to be the supervisor said the middle level a so do we have to make some modifications in our tips activity when we are doing the flipped classroom or outside the classroom when we are doing an kennedy say where to do at the understand and the required level and then have in the classroom in class activity can you do at the applie level limited da should we go beyond that it can we make a little modification yes my question so at the short answer is yes you can feel free to modify the tips activity based on your local scenario because your the expert on the topic that is being taught and you know what your students need however its also important to keep in mind that the analyze and evaluate levels are useful for everybody so for example i know even if they are only going to build something its not just the applied level because at some point so they may have to do some troubleshooting they may have to do some activities of that nature which will require application and analysis both together so its always a good thing to train your students to do something little bit more then what they expected to do the hard work there is one more question it looks like austin is related to the sybian marking technique which is introduced been bebuzz showed the model did lose my problem is that i had not clearly understood the marking technique and i want to know whether she wants to see three there is something like set math theory that is one to three air can a teacher change it according to her discretion i believe your talking about the rubrics are the markings of the rubric are oh so the questions about the marking scheme of the rubric so if you look at the marking schemes the leftmost is our lists up up a least productive a example and the right most of the target performance that we are looking at it so far for the purpose of this particular debbie deb mused a marking scheme that at the lowest one will be up the missing category will be zero andy target performance will be three feet just one mark difference it is just a quantitative are setting a if you want to actually use it in your own of course like you want to use peer assessment using model in your own course yes the teachers have the flexibility to provide marks you can provide are sufficient marks for each of these categories and austins the explanation given for certainty based marking is not very clearly video can you provide some additional material for us to go through or other video by which he can understand the scheme properly sherlock is it seems that it is that it is important as you know one of the very important for instance the case is also based on their sibley marking scheme sure thats a request from a shirt so i ask and ill be posting this up in the subsequent weeks a cai will move on to another center now dronacharya college of engineering
