the detailing it out shortly towards the end of the session or all of you are aware of the grading policies so the first four weeks i will be constituting forty percentage or forty marks am i to say though will be detailing this towards the end of this session where i give you an example case and i hope i am so if there are those kind of questions please put it on hold ask only the relevant questions usually more useful for the community kiwi patil a pimpri chinchwad blaze looking over the phone which scenario as well as the chairman has briefed other depressions and just want to say when we speak assessment invested i was thinking of implementing in the class mentioned it is very true takes it very seriously the rush hour crowd does it as if it is a process to complete it so can something wherein this peer assessment itself as something like two pair share assessment which is for example we are assessing assessments in every participant is doing for the assessment we can put just like nesting went to one year i finally the sharing of the comments i think if it works really it will do for everyone a serious task yes thats a good idea we can have multiple rounds of peer assessment so right now what we are doing is in square in the first stage where just having a one round of peer assessment but what your saying is that we could have multiple people also access the same thing and give feedback however it is important to remember that the it is not possible to get everybody to do it with the same level of seriousness amid the amount of a word you say regimentation that we will have to putin will actually defeat the purpose so we will have to depend upon peoples inherent sincerity in order to carry this out effectively hence my student and to see that every student is brought to yes that was my conceptually yeah so that every student is something that which is a goal which is not attainable because there will always be students in your class who were not interested who will play the game and so on so you know if the general thumb rule in teaching learning is that if eighty per cent of your students are doing eighty per cent of the work that you ask them to do you are doing a good job as a teacher so that serve no more meaningful target to shoot for and yes there will be people who will try to game the system there really is not much that no you dont want to spend too much energy on trying to prevent that from happening here institute you discussed this think pair share technique this active learning techniques in detail so apart from tips a there are other active learning strategies like peer instruction and group discussions so a tips is a used only for theoretical topics so four specialize a numerical type of questions or topics which kind of active learning strategies can we use okay so there are two parts to this one is a tips is used only for theoretical topics actually that is not entirely correct vicar search tips can be used for he also numerical types of a topics for example i use it very routinely in a programming course which is not theoretical seo seo tips is useful in a wide range of topics and as you get more and more confident with implementing the technique you will find that you are able to use it in many many ways the reason why we are introducing tips and peer instruction
