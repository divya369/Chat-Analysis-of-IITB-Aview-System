plus the two main techniques is that these are easy to implement there is very low overhead for you to actually carried out in your classroom the other techniques there are a lot of other techniques like yoga what you mentioned group discussion then there is team pair solo than there is role play then there is no web question a lot of other techniques are there those get a little bit more cumbersome to implement and many of what you can achieve by that you can achieve by these two simple techniques also so for example let us say you have to do some mathematical derivation or something now even if you you can set that up also as a appearing artists activity by giving one step as the thin face and asking students to do the subsequent steps in the preface and the share phase as the instructor you simply summarize how the proof of a certain theorem is supposed to workout so depending upon the question and depending upon how much practice you have had two execute the strategy the strategy is very powerful and can be used for in a non theoretical topics also one one zero seven purnima college question is regarding algebra assessment avians impossible winter although whatever happens with that i see here yet the faculties have not considered that what is hidden in the one or a period of the letter what doom submitted are in the assignment is that what twenty minutes with these activities could be done and getment immaculately witnessed him thirteen additional minute what about the rest of the time to be goggled elector is comprised of demography aminet though anyway i can understand attendance and now youre going on a big lead that is fine but what about the rest of the time i am a committed on lot of our assessment that now please consider the complete nectar time activities are not complete for one hour per illness right now because i deduce marked at times because of this is it right or what could be done okay so let me preface this question so that everyone are able to listen to the question is that typically in ascii three assignments in class activity are the total duration of the activities provided in the in class segment was gently for a less than one hour or so typically all most of you will be familiar with a one hour lecture and yes active learning strategies may constant only twenty to thirty minutes inside so what should be done for assessing these kind of submissions are gently rub the assessment strategies the rubric that too has been provided it is just to check whether they have employed active learning strategy so i would recommend that if they have provided a good active learning strategy and sufficient justification of why this strategies active are you should not reduce the marks but yes what you did is correct supposing somebody has given only for twenty minutes you should provide it in the detailed comment that whatever activity that you provided it is only for twenty minutes duration and there is another forty minutes of lecture or thirty minutes of lecture that needs to be also thought so this comment is a valid one please do not reduce marks so supposing ab reduce marks please go ahead and reassess the person because we dont want any ato the rubrics are general guidelines on these activities and why we havent focused too much on the one hour scheduled us because we wanted them to integrate some active learning strategies as part of their lesson design so its exposing you to the are making you adopt active learning strategies in the classroom so that is why the marks are therefore active learning strategies but yes you should comment that this is not complete you need more time and if you look at the example submission each of the example submission was for one hour so the first example submission had three active learning strategies it had peer instruction it had team pair solo it had thing
