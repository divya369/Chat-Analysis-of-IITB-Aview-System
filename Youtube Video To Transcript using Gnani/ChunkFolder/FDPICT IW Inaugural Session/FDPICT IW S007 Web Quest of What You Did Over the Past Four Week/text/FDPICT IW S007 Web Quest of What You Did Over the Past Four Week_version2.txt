all of the discussion forums upward till day before yesterday and it is seen that there are nearly two thousand five hundred threads that ever created in the discussion forum which a and also had nearly nine thousand five hundred discussions over the past five weeks so i have a list of people who are the top contributors are in this a discussion forum i just read out their names so are the top performer is the jackal he has a nearly two hundred and thirty five contributions in the discussion forum it includes both threads and posts are there is a usa kusuma jana a the who has eighty five posts then there is utterly dass was eighty posts a jati number sana seventy nine and the pile dandy with seventy seventh soup if you look at the second third fourth and fifth there very close and a mind you they are even a lot more in the top twenty the closeness is very so its like buy one post or two post difference that separates the top twenty performers so it is actually a very good a evidence that people are making use of these platforms they are trying so many of these queries were actually answering some of other participants queries regarding technology or different aspects of the assignments so they are not just posted queries they also helped other participants which is very crucial while looking at collaboration and peer assessment was one such form of collaborative activity which was aimed at building the community you will be talking about piracy meant in detail a pretty soon but this is just to give your recap of what we have done across the past four weeks and what we saw as evidence from the a platforms about what is happening in the course okay so what we will do now is address two questions one is about know what can you get out of the scores no wire why this course and all that and another one is about the peer assessment itself so coming to know what can you get out of the scores so they have been many people work said that look all this technology is fine but its not available in our college or no we dont have support and so on and so forth so now the thing to remember here is that like students have moved on from being twentieth century learners to twenty first century learners and it is now well known that for students the important skills in twenty first century is the skill of being able to critically think assimilate information to be able to collaborate and to be able to communicate their ideas these are some of the key skills that are required for students to function effectively in the twenty first century so as teachers we also need to keep up so if you think about what was important in the twentieth century in the twentieth century we did not have a so much access to internet in fact that started only after nineteen eighty five and so on and the and there was no access to vino textbooks especially now we have to depend upon eastern economy editions and things like that so what was really crucial in the twentieth century was information and teachers were the key a purveyors of this information so anybody who had attended talks or who had access to the information or word access to books and journals they were valued at a premium because that information was not accessible to everyone
