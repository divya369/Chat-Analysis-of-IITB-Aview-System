feedbacks or want to build upon the feedbacks so it is only building upon the feedback we wont promote any fights or quarrels because of the poor feedbacks only for those construct people who want to engage with other reviewers we can set up this discussion forum will first check its feasibility if people are taking it up we will definitely put it up in the next week in the in the upcoming weeks pages if dtype is going to last for another four weeks of summer around third or fourth week from now we can set this community up see generally this review process is supposed to be anonymous at all levels know including when you submit a paper to conference the same thing happens that some feedback you get somebody gives you high marks without telling you why somebody gives you no marks without telling you why and they are one or two people whom you feel that okay if i talk to this person i will get more information will be very useful so a the one suggestion but its difficult for the no conference organizers or the course conductors two actually disclose this anonymity but what you could do from your side is you could say that look the person who posted this review committee can take a snippet out of the review comment and you can say okay now on the discussion forum you can see that look i was very happy this review comment i would like to contact you the person who posted this view comment can you please get in touch with me and then you you just have to leave it to the other person depending on whether they want to know engage further or not and if somebody responds then you know who the person is and so on but from the eno institutionally there is nothing because this anonymity is fairly a sacrosanct in a review process are currently moodle in model we have set up a anna are non anonymity only for adults is a single blind review for ra a mood so the reviewers know who they are assessing soap supposing somebody gave your constructive feedback they definitely know that you are one person who have provided a decent job who did a good job so let us hope that they will message you thru model and get in touch with you so there is a messaging mechanism in model and theres also this discussion forum where you can actually get connected with each other with monies so my question is regarding nadal out of the class out of the class activity where we have to create a screencast video the point which i felt that the problem between the screencast video and the teaching in an ink last june on the wood the difference is that while we teaching the class on the board is very easy tool and describe them any numerical problems a solution step by step the problem which is filled in the screencast video is that if there is any deviation or is there any as is the derivation of any equation i cant tell them in a subsequent to be in a proper manner inept in the problem which exists in that the use of tool which uses electronic pen and with the board that would have been much helpful in this case and furthermore i have seen that in order to create this as your tool that in order to create an out of the class a screencast video the length must be must be shot within ten minutes that will make them make that will make the students interested in the video the point is if we want to create a video in ten minutes and i want to deliver maximum of the concept then the video must be very much interactive the point is that in order to create a video very much interactive it is not just you we can do alone did they must be an immense the editing demasi video editing they must be background animations
