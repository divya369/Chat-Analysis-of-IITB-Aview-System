them are doing it seriously and some of them are not doing and i had an assessment wherein they were two people sharing the same video how do we assess such people what would be the pure assessment for such hi tech the videos weather seal exactly the sea and the topic was also busy okay so are typically are thus this might be a top of the wanted individual works to come in our resource creation assignments because we wanted to explosive if there are cases like this typically this is a case of plagiarized content which is strictly forbidden in this particular a if we even had all of you submit or ethical stinkwood a statement agreeing that i wont do such practices and if there are some sharing or sharing of ideas it would be acknowledged sober approach of watercolours going to detail about the policy against plagiarism or tomorrow so please hold on to your queries are till then we could see a bear asked to upload our skin and screencast video in youtube also be on selecting the optional feet commonly use monitoring disposals on whos giving does not of lions was a new brief something about creative commons license and equip standard license creative commons is actually an organization which was a reaction to no standard copyright a rule so its just like that copyright is very a extreme in the sense that others cannot use your copyright at all on the other hand no way in teaching learning often instructors feel that they want to share their material with other instructors now the question that came up was you know how to share without losing any of your own rights so you dont want like you dont want to give something out into the open and later on somebody else claim that completely as their own because you didnt attach any license to it so creative commons is kind of response to that in the sense that it has various levels of licence at the lowest level its called creative commons by attribution by attribution means that your name will always have to be carried forward whenever anybody uses your work or makes a derivative work from yours and they are also a more restrictive versions are more like for example creative commons attribution noncommercial share alike and so on so what we feel is that in the educational space it is sufficient to go with the creative commons attribution license if somebody is going to take your video and dino make money out of it the people who are reno students of that video are eventually going to come back to you because youre the originator of such a video so creative commons attribution is often sufficient is simply to safeguard you saying that okay youre the first person who created that video and its not as restrictive as copyright saying that were the other person cannot do anything with a video that is the idea behind creative commons look a krishna institute of engineering that if someone has missed i see three though if they reach the edison breeding polic e that we took all of this mean okay so ill just generalize this so the question as somebody has missed an assignment for the other questions specifically about article submission and grading policy says that all assignments are mandatory for theresa we have already defined an alternate mechanism for it it is the course portfolio page we have asked everyone each and every one of you to submit whatever work you have done as part of this are afk in your own course portfolio page in wiki now arm are the policies that the due dates are non negotiable
