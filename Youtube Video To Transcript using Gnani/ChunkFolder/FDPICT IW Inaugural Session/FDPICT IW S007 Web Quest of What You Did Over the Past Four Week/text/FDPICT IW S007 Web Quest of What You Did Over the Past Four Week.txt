semesters are in your own art teaching learning context so let me just quickly recap are the why what and how of the first four weeks of activity that was a that actually give you an exposure to the arm effective integration of a technology in your own classrooms specifically for ra online and blended education so in the first week it was an introduction week there were it was very light and we had a people we had activities that would help you to familiarize with both the platforms muddle and ati bombay exe so in moodle we had the a wiki activity of course portfolio where we saw that participants are came in a thai made edits to pages they created their own page they wrote their own teaching learning mission statement etc and dub in general you explored the itee bombacks platforms through the demo course and also you are some of you are familiar with model so you saw some submissions happening in the mood like the entry servian and etc in the second week we actually started with the arm core aspect that is flipped classroom the idea of flip classroom there were videos which were called learning dialogues we call them learning dialogue videos that familiarize you with the concept of a flipped classroom badawi what and how they were ill be d activities or practice activities aimed at reinforcing what ever you saw in the video and there was a discussion forum set up so that you could collaborate you could discuss about various aspects of flip clasp are specifically there was this active learning strategy think pair share that could be utilized in a non general classroom beat up flipped one or a face to face it it is applicable for a face to face classroom also and you had attempted the first resource creation submission which was actually a think pair share activity for your classroom after the face to face interaction where we explained the various features are we also talked about how awesome this is becomes more meaningful how it becomes more effective the next week be focused on a screencast creation admins you were exposed to the technology during the face to face interaction and in the subsequent week you actually created an activity a screencast activity for your own a course this was followed by our in class activity for the screencast so actually we created an entire flip classroom activity through resource creation assignments two and three and you had been exposed to both the technology of screencast as well as the pedagogy the active learning pedagogies that could be utilized in arm a doing the in class activity now across all three weeks we had employed a method called peer assessment such that which is aimed at improving the collaboration are providing learners with more detailed and descriptive feedback and generating a sense of community community ownership for all the activities that you do as part of this workshop the adi learning platforms id bombacks and moodle also had the discussion forums the discussion forums primarily focused in a dirty bomb bags so we had just collected arm some statistics all of the discussion forums upward till day before yesterday and it is seen that there are nearly two thousand five hundred threads that ever created in the discussion forum which a and also had nearly nine thousand five hundred discussions over the past five weeks so i have a list of people who are the top contributors are in this a discussion forum i just read out their names so are the top performer is the jackal he has a nearly two hundred and thirty five contributions in the discussion forum it includes both threads and posts are there is a usa kusuma jana a the who has eighty five posts then there is utterly dass was eighty posts a jati number sana seventy nine and the pile dandy with seventy seventh soup if you look at the second third fourth and fifth there very close and a mind you they are even a lot more in the top twenty the closeness is very so its like buy one post or two post difference that separates the top twenty performers so it is actually a very good a evidence that people are making use of these platforms they are trying so many of these queries were actually answering some of other participants queries regarding technology or different aspects of the assignments so they are not just posted queries they also helped other participants which is very crucial while looking at collaboration and peer assessment was one such form of collaborative activity which was aimed at building the community you will be talking about piracy meant in detail a pretty soon but this is just to give your recap of what we have done across the past four weeks and what we saw as evidence from the a platforms about what is happening in the course okay so what we will do now is address two questions one is about know what can you get out of the scores no wire why this course and all that and another one is about the peer assessment itself so coming to know what can you get out of the scores so they have been many people work said that look all this technology is fine but its not available in our college or no we dont have support and so on and so forth so now the thing to remember here is that like students have moved on from being twentieth century learners to twenty first century learners and it is now well known that for students the important skills in twenty first century is the skill of being able to critically think assimilate information to be able to collaborate and to be able to communicate their ideas these are some of the key skills that are required for students to function effectively in the twenty first century so as teachers we also need to keep up so if you think about what was important in the twentieth century in the twentieth century we did not have a so much access to internet in fact that started only after nineteen eighty five and so on and the and there was no access to vino textbooks especially now we have to depend upon eastern economy editions and things like that so what was really crucial in the twentieth century was information and teachers were the key a purveyors of this information so anybody who had attended talks or who had access to the information or word access to books and journals they were valued at a premium because that information was not accessible to everyone so if you had the information and if you had the ability to communicate that information effectively you are considered to be a good teacher in the twentieth century since twenty first century however thats no longer true everybody has access to the information in fact while youre conducting a class its possible that lot of students will be no checking online immediately about what your saying what are the counter points to the point that youre making and so so the access to information is no longer a problem so what is important now as teachers is for us to be able to help students to develop these skills of critical thinking of collaboration and being able to evaluate and synthesize information into what is useful for them okay so one of the reasons for the safety is that while you may not be able to implement all of these techniques in your classroom so we are not expecting that hundred percent of you will be able to implement hundred per cent of all the techniques that are being taught but however what is important is to have the awareness so there is a a there are formal models one of them is called the technology integration matrix a which has various stages that a teacher goes through in integrating technology into their teaching learning process the first step here is awareness do you have to first be aware that such technologies exist and irrespective of whether you can use them in your class today or not this awareness is what contributes towards your becoming more effective the second step is to develop some appreciation for the technology or what it can do to be able to critically evaluate okay when will this technology be useful in my class when i should use it when i need not use it and so on okay so awareness is the first step then appreciation is the second step then comes adoption in italy the third step that you actually adopt the technology the technology now hear can be a a i city base technology or it can simply be a classroom based technology which is a pedagogy basically so all of these things the whole idea is that once you develop the awareness and appreciation that is when itll be possible to adopt them in the classroom so if a large number of you now all of you would have reached the awareness stage so the way we have designed this program is through a principle called immersively wherein you are in instead of simply telling you about these things we have actually made you experience them as a learner and we have made you create such activities for the learners in your class so that is the steps that we are taking to say that okay after awareness we can do appreciation because you have actually engaged in such an activity and then you go to adoption wherein you create such activities for your students so even if you are not able to implement all the activities that you create there is no need to feel that you know this is just for somebody else its not useful for me the awareness in the appreciation will go a long way and maybe a couple of years down the line a lot of these will become possible to implement on a routine basis in many classrooms so that is one of the things that i wanted to kind of emphasis in this survey todays interaction the other point that i wanted to emphasize is the point about collaboration so just like ive been saying that its a students need to develop the skill of collaboration we as teachers also need to develop the skill of collaboration is now this happens in multiple ways two of which we are adopting in this course is one way is the collaborative resource creation so that is what a christian was saying some time back where we will be having community resources which we created and these resources collaboratively created by all of us becomes a global this resource for any of us to use in our classrooms so now one way of one important thing of getting this resource created at a fairly high quality level is the peer assessment issue now why so what we have seen is that some people have taken the peer assessment seriously both in terms of submitting the assignment as well as in terms of giving feedback to their peers whereas others have kind of just done it because it is part of the requirement and so on so what i would like to mention here is peer assessment is not just a duty that we perform case not simply because we have set it up and no we dont have that ace to go through all the assignments and give feedback so what they are two things that happen during peer assessment a one is you are giving useful feedback to your peer so that feedback is definitely useful but what do you get out of it why should you bother let the fear worry about their submission themselves why should you take the trouble so the answer to that is that when you take the trouble to go through what your peers have done your learning also improves so this is a strategy that we have used even in undergraduate classrooms we have had students evaluate each others papers okay and what happens the feedback invariably has been is that i have learned something by seeing the other persons answer so either i have learned something new or have got a new idea or i have learnt what should be done and saw isaac students invariably in the beginning they always feel that this peer assessment is a chore and not something to be done seriously but then once they get the hang of it they realize that a lot of learning happens during the assessment itself that is one a difference between the safety and others that you may have undergone in many courses the purpose of assessment is to grade is to award a grade to the lirr okay whereas in our course the purpose of assessment is also learning the purpose of assessment is not grading but the purpose of assessment is learning so when youre assessing your pier the more seriously you look at the submission made by the pier and the more critically evaluated based on the rubrics that are given the more your own learning increases and your feedback also becomes useful to the person whos a submission your evaluating so theyre learning also increases so peer assessment dont think of peer assessment as an evaluation technique by which somebodys given some marks peer assessment is actually a learning technique by which both the person were submitted and the person was assessed or who is assessing both of them get to learn something in the process and this is known to be a effective way of learning rather than the instructor simply ino giving feedback or tears looking at it and giving feedback so that is a reason why we have so much emphasis on peer assessment in this course and why we need you to take the peer assessment phase fairly seriously so with that i think we dont have anything more to say from our end so we will go into the interaction face so if they are if anybody has questions please feel free to do a hand race so just in case a pub sub towards the end of the interaction will be detailing out be a marking schemes so we have received a lot of query so some of the commonly asked questions how does peer assessment is how i have had problems with peer assessment so one part part of it has already been addressed right now the other major queries regarding the grading mechanisms for the first component that is the effectiveness the pedagogy of integrating arm i sit in classrooms will be the detailing it out shortly towards the end of the session or all of you are aware of the grading policies so the first four weeks i will be constituting forty percentage or forty marks am i to say though will be detailing this towards the end of this session where i give you an example case and i hope i am so if there are those kind of questions please put it on hold ask only the relevant questions usually more useful for the community kiwi patil a pimpri chinchwad blaze looking over the phone which scenario as well as the chairman has briefed other depressions and just want to say when we speak assessment invested i was thinking of implementing in the class mentioned it is very true takes it very seriously the rush hour crowd does it as if it is a process to complete it so can something wherein this peer assessment itself as something like two pair share assessment which is for example we are assessing assessments in every participant is doing for the assessment we can put just like nesting went to one year i finally the sharing of the comments i think if it works really it will do for everyone a serious task yes thats a good idea we can have multiple rounds of peer assessment so right now what we are doing is in square in the first stage where just having a one round of peer assessment but what your saying is that we could have multiple people also access the same thing and give feedback however it is important to remember that the it is not possible to get everybody to do it with the same level of seriousness amid the amount of a word you say regimentation that we will have to putin will actually defeat the purpose so we will have to depend upon peoples inherent sincerity in order to carry this out effectively hence my student and to see that every student is brought to yes that was my conceptually yeah so that every student is something that which is a goal which is not attainable because there will always be students in your class who were not interested who will play the game and so on so you know if the general thumb rule in teaching learning is that if eighty per cent of your students are doing eighty per cent of the work that you ask them to do you are doing a good job as a teacher so that serve no more meaningful target to shoot for and yes there will be people who will try to game the system there really is not much that no you dont want to spend too much energy on trying to prevent that from happening here institute you discussed this think pair share technique this active learning techniques in detail so apart from tips a there are other active learning strategies like peer instruction and group discussions so a tips is a used only for theoretical topics so four specialize a numerical type of questions or topics which kind of active learning strategies can we use okay so there are two parts to this one is a tips is used only for theoretical topics actually that is not entirely correct vicar search tips can be used for he also numerical types of a topics for example i use it very routinely in a programming course which is not theoretical seo seo tips is useful in a wide range of topics and as you get more and more confident with implementing the technique you will find that you are able to use it in many many ways the reason why we are introducing tips and peer instruction plus the two main techniques is that these are easy to implement there is very low overhead for you to actually carried out in your classroom the other techniques there are a lot of other techniques like yoga what you mentioned group discussion then there is team pair solo than there is role play then there is no web question a lot of other techniques are there those get a little bit more cumbersome to implement and many of what you can achieve by that you can achieve by these two simple techniques also so for example let us say you have to do some mathematical derivation or something now even if you you can set that up also as a appearing artists activity by giving one step as the thin face and asking students to do the subsequent steps in the preface and the share phase as the instructor you simply summarize how the proof of a certain theorem is supposed to workout so depending upon the question and depending upon how much practice you have had two execute the strategy the strategy is very powerful and can be used for in a non theoretical topics also one one zero seven purnima college question is regarding algebra assessment avians impossible winter although whatever happens with that i see here yet the faculties have not considered that what is hidden in the one or a period of the letter what doom submitted are in the assignment is that what twenty minutes with these activities could be done and getment immaculately witnessed him thirteen additional minute what about the rest of the time to be goggled elector is comprised of demography aminet though anyway i can understand attendance and now youre going on a big lead that is fine but what about the rest of the time i am a committed on lot of our assessment that now please consider the complete nectar time activities are not complete for one hour per illness right now because i deduce marked at times because of this is it right or what could be done okay so let me preface this question so that everyone are able to listen to the question is that typically in ascii three assignments in class activity are the total duration of the activities provided in the in class segment was gently for a less than one hour or so typically all most of you will be familiar with a one hour lecture and yes active learning strategies may constant only twenty to thirty minutes inside so what should be done for assessing these kind of submissions are gently rub the assessment strategies the rubric that too has been provided it is just to check whether they have employed active learning strategy so i would recommend that if they have provided a good active learning strategy and sufficient justification of why this strategies active are you should not reduce the marks but yes what you did is correct supposing somebody has given only for twenty minutes you should provide it in the detailed comment that whatever activity that you provided it is only for twenty minutes duration and there is another forty minutes of lecture or thirty minutes of lecture that needs to be also thought so this comment is a valid one please do not reduce marks so supposing ab reduce marks please go ahead and reassess the person because we dont want any ato the rubrics are general guidelines on these activities and why we havent focused too much on the one hour scheduled us because we wanted them to integrate some active learning strategies as part of their lesson design so its exposing you to the are making you adopt active learning strategies in the classroom so that is why the marks are therefore active learning strategies but yes you should comment that this is not complete you need more time and if you look at the example submission each of the example submission was for one hour so the first example submission had three active learning strategies it had peer instruction it had team pair solo it had thing in persia whereas the second one i had only one on one or two active learning strategies but still it had time allotted for one or two this is an important thing that needs to be focused while doing a lesson designed the entire a lecture has to be focused sardar patel institute i have a liking to perrys fencing is a teen peer assessment where getting feedback from the people there talkin implement any other mechanism where we can even just sit back concealed back then it will be like like youre some kind of psycho values their feedback because we have seen that thing most of the people they are not even looking at the segment engages in some random kind of like comments so sometimes it is like a very dismal demotivating and another thing that i long to suggestions that i mean maybe from your tears or something like two thre a baby exporting that particular can be appointed as a like observing this particular process so is it possible to implement this mechanism so both of these are good ideas i know one way in which year in which you can give feedback on feedback is to be simply able to say no to what extent you agree with his back and to what extent that feedback was useful to you you know so a simple rating of the feedback is possible i dont know to what extent our system will be able to implement this right away and the second thing about no expertise at our end evaluating so some a little bit of that is possible but it cannot be done on a large scale simply because of numbers allow we dont have that many number of days and so what we will see is to what extent it is possible for you to rate the feedback that is given to you i think that is a good suggestion we will try to see whether it is possible for you to say hello i strongly agree with the feedback this feedback was useful to me or not and in that way we can at least know who are the people were giving useful feedback and or not so are just too answer based on technology yes our current model pair assessment are has this drawback that you are not able to give feedback on feedback so that is why we have a separate feedback about the peer assessment process so where we have asked you how a detail did you give feedback harmony reviews did you get arm how helpful were the feedbacks the peer feedback to you and me gently asked an open ended question on what your own feelings about the peer assessment process so that is one mechanism through which we have implemented the feedback and feedback are the other case as pressure higher noted adi massiveness than are the scale and the diversity both are some issues or if he were to target arm monitoring or other kinds of activities one a implicit a goal of this workshop is that the community themselves will be a moderators are themselves so that is why this peer assessment processes kept a in and there are lot of incentives for collaboration good collaboration are effective collaboration practices throughout this arm just in addition to that end i had one thing i was able to see the thing i mean at least like insurance submitted the submissions they should bring some chance to reassess on all the feedback and give some kind of like a man that thinks it is we can know whether the participants really satisfying her not a sober are so after the first four weeks we can open those assignments back in the assessment phase and or if other people do want to reassess they can go ahead and do a reassessment for the arm for those submissions that is possible that it was an answer by kelley jones today the inspector the havoc this question is related to the cognitive levels so now i am representing a polytechnique my faculties in the from a polytechnic so it is generally understood that while a teaching technique the students are required to reach the applie level the recall understanding and apply level and normally we do not go beyond that the analysis level recall amin evaluation level and the creative level because they say a tsa students are supposed to be trained to be the supervisor said the middle level a so do we have to make some modifications in our tips activity when we are doing the flipped classroom or outside the classroom when we are doing an kennedy say where to do at the understand and the required level and then have in the classroom in class activity can you do at the applie level limited da should we go beyond that it can we make a little modification yes my question so at the short answer is yes you can feel free to modify the tips activity based on your local scenario because your the expert on the topic that is being taught and you know what your students need however its also important to keep in mind that the analyze and evaluate levels are useful for everybody so for example i know even if they are only going to build something its not just the applied level because at some point so they may have to do some troubleshooting they may have to do some activities of that nature which will require application and analysis both together so its always a good thing to train your students to do something little bit more then what they expected to do the hard work there is one more question it looks like austin is related to the sybian marking technique which is introduced been bebuzz showed the model did lose my problem is that i had not clearly understood the marking technique and i want to know whether she wants to see three there is something like set math theory that is one to three air can a teacher change it according to her discretion i believe your talking about the rubrics are the markings of the rubric are oh so the questions about the marking scheme of the rubric so if you look at the marking schemes the leftmost is our lists up up a least productive a example and the right most of the target performance that we are looking at it so far for the purpose of this particular debbie deb mused a marking scheme that at the lowest one will be up the missing category will be zero andy target performance will be three feet just one mark difference it is just a quantitative are setting a if you want to actually use it in your own of course like you want to use peer assessment using model in your own course yes the teachers have the flexibility to provide marks you can provide are sufficient marks for each of these categories and austins the explanation given for certainty based marking is not very clearly video can you provide some additional material for us to go through or other video by which he can understand the scheme properly sherlock is it seems that it is that it is important as you know one of the very important for instance the case is also based on their sibley marking scheme sure thats a request from a shirt so i ask and ill be posting this up in the subsequent weeks a cai will move on to another center now dronacharya college of engineering should money be jackal on the discussion forum one night only act i posted a thread it was basically rated the common mistakes people do in pasting the hyper link on the assignments for activity and this go to suggest one thing let us understand the importance of pasting link because pasting the link from slight on the address bar is a very time consuming meanwhile to make this particular link add a workable which can be clicked and to go to the youtube i do not have in most of the cases this can be found out because i assign and assessed fourty nine assessments out forty ninth only four assessment could have proper link on list that includes me so i can see that food by people how to foot and poor people are actually doing that mistakes at the threadwatch stakes in pasting your oral on the activity so kindly take this matter up and because nobody responded late including top at bombay yeah just wanted mitt rick what mistake but gordon to understand how we are good pace the bid documents and be to either so kindly take up this propert etched and cut it short so i think that call for the suggestion yes we will implement this or maybe will add this onto the constructors every constructor documents that were building will provide a essential guides on how to do this controversy control being effectively thus copy pasting so yes will do this thank you wroc central university of rajasthan assert there is a simple query arm i have uploaded i have given it back on defense activity uploaded by a nurse presumably there is a return that poor activity has to be submitted but i have did the teen activity at the institute and in my feedback based queries across a mention that you have this much number is remaining i want to clarify whether poor was of a book whose own evaluation we reviewed this simple vanilla so yes i also only forest sufficient that crosses because it is it the model setting for model has assigned you forty or fifty assignments but we have asked you to do only four so we will be taking care of that at the backend and avail be making necessary adjustments are sad to see that so a do not worry about the crossmark evil that is a system setting so visvesvaraya national institute yep a ing in pure assessment i got feedback which was mostly ritualistic and sue when someone gave me very poor school i couldnt understand my weaknesses and sven semin scored me highly i could learn about my students but out of all these feedbacks i got one very constructive feedback and i would really love to be in touch with that person is there any way in which i can see the contact details of that person as kirsten provided that the other person is willing yeah so you understand the predicament the gap so one arm mechanism that you can provide a hub that has been already provided us the itee bombay exe as a discussion forum specifically for community building so based on your domain we have provided a mechanism where this has been promoted what additionally we can do is we can create a discussion forum where specifically where peers want to discuss feedbacks or want to build upon the feedbacks so it is only building upon the feedback we wont promote any fights or quarrels because of the poor feedbacks only for those construct people who want to engage with other reviewers we can set up this discussion forum will first check its feasibility if people are taking it up we will definitely put it up in the next week in the in the upcoming weeks pages if dtype is going to last for another four weeks of summer around third or fourth week from now we can set this community up see generally this review process is supposed to be anonymous at all levels know including when you submit a paper to conference the same thing happens that some feedback you get somebody gives you high marks without telling you why somebody gives you no marks without telling you why and they are one or two people whom you feel that okay if i talk to this person i will get more information will be very useful so a the one suggestion but its difficult for the no conference organizers or the course conductors two actually disclose this anonymity but what you could do from your side is you could say that look the person who posted this review committee can take a snippet out of the review comment and you can say okay now on the discussion forum you can see that look i was very happy this review comment i would like to contact you the person who posted this view comment can you please get in touch with me and then you you just have to leave it to the other person depending on whether they want to know engage further or not and if somebody responds then you know who the person is and so on but from the eno institutionally there is nothing because this anonymity is fairly a sacrosanct in a review process are currently moodle in model we have set up a anna are non anonymity only for adults is a single blind review for ra a mood so the reviewers know who they are assessing soap supposing somebody gave your constructive feedback they definitely know that you are one person who have provided a decent job who did a good job so let us hope that they will message you thru model and get in touch with you so there is a messaging mechanism in model and theres also this discussion forum where you can actually get connected with each other with monies so my question is regarding nadal out of the class out of the class activity where we have to create a screencast video the point which i felt that the problem between the screencast video and the teaching in an ink last june on the wood the difference is that while we teaching the class on the board is very easy tool and describe them any numerical problems a solution step by step the problem which is filled in the screencast video is that if there is any deviation or is there any as is the derivation of any equation i cant tell them in a subsequent to be in a proper manner inept in the problem which exists in that the use of tool which uses electronic pen and with the board that would have been much helpful in this case and furthermore i have seen that in order to create this as your tool that in order to create an out of the class a screencast video the length must be must be shot within ten minutes that will make them make that will make the students interested in the video the point is if we want to create a video in ten minutes and i want to deliver maximum of the concept then the video must be very much interactive the point is that in order to create a video very much interactive it is not just you we can do alone did they must be an immense the editing demasi video editing they must be background animations as something most processing of the video must be done so that requires manpower just no not alone a faculty can make an interactive screen cuz video and minutes it will given efficient debt will deliver an efficient concept to the students so i think that if you want to implement out of the class activity much more than they must be an increase the manpower regarding the post processing of the screencast videos a yes so were the at a broad level yes your right that if we want to create this it is going to take effort so it takes effort on the part of the faculty also too because you have to now change the style of a talking and i know you can talk the way you would normally talk in the classroom and its useful to have some other post processing to make the video effective however what we have to keep in mind is that what you are creating screencasts is not for a purely online course no its only when you are going to do a purely online course we need that level of fidelity in the video itself since you are going to augment this with an inclass activity the right now let us just have the goal of no doing basic information transmission in the screencast video so that the background material which the students are supposed to know before they come to class that material is covered so what your saying all of it is valid if we want the student to learn piano mostly through the screen cast itself whereas here what you are attempting is to make the student learn some part through the screen cast the background material and then when they come and do the in class activities in your presence that is when the maximum part of the learning is happening so this exercise of albino having oppose production team which will create the video anol now that its it depends upon whether it is available whether the resources are available they cannot be made available centrally so depending upon the attention you can decide to what extent so it is i know its a challenge for the instructor to decide what to do in the screencast which is effective at the same time which is not very time consuming for them so other detailing that we must deliver in the screencast video minister details the amount of details that you hit deliver so it should be that so much in details because they will be an overall summary and then in the class we will do the detailing of that topics episode i generally thats a good idea in the sense that dino you introduce the topic the screencast video and you create activities which will help the student to do the detailing see the idea is that you should reduce the amount of work that you do in the class on the board so whatever you would have done on the board some of it goes into the screencast and some of it goes as activities where the students were watch the screencast there comment derive the subsequent steps and youre there facilitating the process of their learning so you are right okay national institute of technology i would like to see what do you think about peoples outside the class okay ha ha its a valid question are there are mechanisms are also people have adopted are different technologies to use think pair share outside classrooms for example wikis have been used but there are individual pair a individual pages there is a collaborative page and finally there are entire thing as visible as a common are edited page somebody had used google drive are to do this process there are also what is hip or other technology tools like patlite etc which facilitate these kind of online no arm outside the classroom and online purely online mode of think pair share so yes it is doable but make sure that there is some kind of moderation that you are doing so you dont want everybody to post random thoughts so some guidance to beta in class tips or outside class tips the teepee yes has to be very carefully designed and implemented by the instructor also a sort of in a lighter vein that atp is will anyway happen outside class okay because before the exam your students are ready we going to be talking to each other they are going to be no discussing and all of that so what the important focus for you is to make sure that it happens in class also no so if we what we want to do is effectively utilize time see you are the resource and that resource should be available to the student for doing you know higher cognitive level activities when they are doing higher cognitive level activities that is a time when they need your presence so in the class the more number of such activities you organize and dino youre able to execute the more beneficial it will be to the students outside of the class know you could go ahead and do all the online tips activities but that will anyway happen you know around the web because students will talk to each other especially noob just before the exams thats a fairly a natural process that happens i am not pointing out that i am talking home structured but informal probably dependability do i think its funny but a structured way of doing infinite share nightly to it i think the headache and also alerts are pointed out it is not necessary why open necessary to have it online you have been eating out can even have that offline mode but the structure what we do it in e he unearths sipc nasdaq we can even have a bigger penis how to reconcile that gives more time movie we can have it inside it nothing thats fine but now we can give that part time at all we can give more time but doing something more deep and into the higher up and thats what my opinion worry think would be a yes it is valid are again what you said is correct so doing it in a structured way just ensure that as an instructor your presence is also present in the out of the class because generally all these activities as prosser riot are told you right now other students should also feel that the instructor support is also present that is what they get inside the class so if this some amount of it is also present outside the class there is no harm in it she in in the tips activity the instructor has two important roles first role is in structuring setting up of the activity what will happen in the think face what will happen in the pair face and so okay so if the instructor does not do a proper job there then the tips will fail so if the instructor is done a proper job in the think faced the pair face these two perhaps can happen outside the classroom however the instructor also has a major role to play in the share face so if the shares is going to happen outside the classroom the instructor has to figure out a way to be present during the surface so ideally allow even if you want to do tips out of class what i would recommend is that you can let them think phase and the pair face happen out of class but the sheer face you must have you know you your presence is necessary during the share phase in order to know summarize in order to re clarify a common errors that are being made and so on okay there seems to be one more question at the center here i go with a peer assessment process net united account them are doing it seriously and some of them are not doing and i had an assessment wherein they were two people sharing the same video how do we assess such people what would be the pure assessment for such hi tech the videos weather seal exactly the sea and the topic was also busy okay so are typically are thus this might be a top of the wanted individual works to come in our resource creation assignments because we wanted to explosive if there are cases like this typically this is a case of plagiarized content which is strictly forbidden in this particular a if we even had all of you submit or ethical stinkwood a statement agreeing that i wont do such practices and if there are some sharing or sharing of ideas it would be acknowledged sober approach of watercolours going to detail about the policy against plagiarism or tomorrow so please hold on to your queries are till then we could see a bear asked to upload our skin and screencast video in youtube also be on selecting the optional feet commonly use monitoring disposals on whos giving does not of lions was a new brief something about creative commons license and equip standard license creative commons is actually an organization which was a reaction to no standard copyright a rule so its just like that copyright is very a extreme in the sense that others cannot use your copyright at all on the other hand no way in teaching learning often instructors feel that they want to share their material with other instructors now the question that came up was you know how to share without losing any of your own rights so you dont want like you dont want to give something out into the open and later on somebody else claim that completely as their own because you didnt attach any license to it so creative commons is kind of response to that in the sense that it has various levels of licence at the lowest level its called creative commons by attribution by attribution means that your name will always have to be carried forward whenever anybody uses your work or makes a derivative work from yours and they are also a more restrictive versions are more like for example creative commons attribution noncommercial share alike and so on so what we feel is that in the educational space it is sufficient to go with the creative commons attribution license if somebody is going to take your video and dino make money out of it the people who are reno students of that video are eventually going to come back to you because youre the originator of such a video so creative commons attribution is often sufficient is simply to safeguard you saying that okay youre the first person who created that video and its not as restrictive as copyright saying that were the other person cannot do anything with a video that is the idea behind creative commons look a krishna institute of engineering that if someone has missed i see three though if they reach the edison breeding polic e that we took all of this mean okay so ill just generalize this so the question as somebody has missed an assignment for the other questions specifically about article submission and grading policy says that all assignments are mandatory for theresa we have already defined an alternate mechanism for it it is the course portfolio page we have asked everyone each and every one of you to submit whatever work you have done as part of this are afk in your own course portfolio page in wiki now arm are the policies that the due dates are non negotiable i am also the assessment of these will not be possible to typically you get zero marks for this submission but it will also ensure that you are eligible for the certificate it will make you eligible for certification if you post it in the course portfolio page problem is that we can submit it on the whole portfolio exactly exactly what was a swing will not be the submissions will not be so whatever is the submission will just see whether you have submitted all the relevant submissions for the afc a these will not be assessed this is just to ensure that you have created all those activities but again these will be checked for plagiarism and if we find plagiarism the addy a action make for the plagiarism will be detail by prosafe protect mode bears him college of engineering the i think the question i didnt catch it fully but the question was how learning is possible while we are evaluating our peers so were like i mentioned the sometime in the beginning there are two types of learning that is happening one is the feedback that you get from others so that is its that thats like the standard evaluation where you get a mark from the teacher and you know get comments on the teacher about what you can improve the other one is when youre the teacher and when youre the evaluator so what happens is that since you are also in the same domain and youre also teaching similar topics this peer assessment the learning that happens is you you get a lot of ideas so you get ideas on okay i can do a tips like this also i can modify some activity in this manner i can create a screencast in this manner so these are the kind of ideas that you get when you are looking at other peoples submissions and also you are always crosschecking somebody submissions without detailed rubric are which has characteristics of target performance so you always evaluate the submission against this target performance and this becomes a learning for you my question is regarding the greedy fat migrates to the crazy something which is theoretically based whereas when we write assignments it something that is based on creativity and innovation classes sunlight easily seen that assessment criteria should be changed where pieces can be considered theoretical level and are degraded in a much better way okay the point is taken that assessments can improve but a yes we are addressing the question so we have three mechanisms of fab a what you said assessments in this particular first four weeks post further knowledge quizzes which actually looked at the theoretical concepts that you learnt then there was a reflection quiz which was about the participation that happened in the discussion forum should a did you go and check the discussion forums so as to encourage what is happening are within the community and a third one the resource creation assessment is actually about the creativity the rubrics if it is very open ended and we have actually tried to address it through rubrics rubrics give some details and there is some subjectivity in assessment and we have provided it does peer assessment a practice so let me take a couple of queries which are there in the chat window there is one query from sardar patel institute of technology and theory which says no we generally use blooms taxonomy but the coaps model is advance compared to blooms taxonomy eyes the kolbs model difficult to implement so actually there are many models its not just a blooms and colds are just two of them and you know we have pick blooms taxonomy because it is very widely used and it is sufficient for our purposes so that is the main reason that we are going with the new revised blooms taxonomy you you are free to implement any other model also as per you know what works well for your class a case there is a question stab which says some of our participants are not able to submit the archies okay this is again so people were not able to submit any assignment make sure that you submitted as part of the course portfolio are unfortunately we wont be able to assess or evaluate them but it will ensure that you have provided all submissions as mandated in the grading policy there are couple of more such questions like couple of participants have missed the first week of the face to face session are eligible to attend the rest of the sessions and complete the course so are participants were missed face to face session so beat the first one or the current one please make sure that you send out an detailed email to e outreach team who are coordinating with the a in this workshop and get the feedback from them so theyll be providing you details on what to do and what happens in case you have missed a session so typically these face to face sessions are for interactions not this interaction with the instructor but interaction among your arses so make sure that the interaction happens and we have the videos of these office to face interaction sessions uploaded in the iati bombacks platform to make a you go through it and do all the activities that are there in those sessions okay going back to the interaction a polarity college my question is regarding peer assessment activity the assessment list in mind some of the activities are listed which are not belongs to my domain like mathematics physics he also as far as possible we have tried to ensure that participants from the same domain get submissions from the others through the group choice so it may have happened that other people who have submitted a wrong submissions they would have selected are wrong group to join so that might be the reason that is why you are getting this so one possible way to ensure that they get a job if you have a do not have sufficient assessment and you are forced to do these assessments then kindly take the help of the community who are from this particular domain either in your college or through the itee bombax platform get in touch with people who are in this particular domains are to check for the validity of the submissions i would advise you if you have more assessments with soap a typically you have sixteen seventeen assignments per are resource creation so as far as possible try to stick to your domain so that you can give an honest feedback about the activities loki marathwada institute of technology i my question is are whatever we are learning now it is just offline without student and actually in one semester will start you want to implement easy classes so when we want to go for out of class activity whether we have to give a constructor or in other forms to the students work these activities so the purpose of the constructor is to help you how to create the activity so you dont have to give the constructor to the students you just have to create the activity and ask them to carry it out so students need not be shown any constructors or any rubrics are anything they have to just simply do the activities that you have created for them so they have to watch the out of class video there to come in class there to do the tips or the peer instruction whatever is the activity the constructor is merely an aid for you to create the activity we there is no need to ask students to create such activities okay anomymous morning sir i am from i see one one zero three to the point and my question theoretical subject red eye exam is focused on the lower cognitive skills such as apply understand and recall how to justify the higher cognitive skills activities of evaluate analyze and create soap a depends upon where the exam is no if you have some control on the internal assessment that is where you can utilize this is the main thing is that students have to understand the benefit of these higher cognitive level activity so that if youre able to communicate to the students then irrespective of whether it is there in the exam or is not there in the exam they will still cooperate with you but if you dont have any control over the exam and if it is just organized by somebody else and theyre all full of recall understand level questions then there is really not much you can do about it okay i will be taking the final two questions because at the session is about to end and then will are also a discuss about the grading strategy for the first four we will explain the marking scheme o archive one zero eight two to the pan instead of technology and management yes this is related to resource creation assigning to a winner i am seeing them a performance of the league in assists fears it was us that we should do minimum poor assessment and where i have done six essays assessments but still there is a red cross and i am not able to understand why the red cross there and i have submitted the sign before deadline ah so this is a common query every person in the model would be seeing a red cross in the assessment phase this is the soldier setting or in models it just says that you have and assist all the assessments that were given to you but at the back and we are ensuring that we have given you the advice that you have to access only four so if you are submitting four please do not worry about the red cross that comes in the assessment phase it is perfectly valid but if your not a beer checking that at the basket so do not worry about the red cross kitchen second question is that enriches creation assignment try again the again having the same query that it was asked to review your assessments and a twenty four were given and i did four but then the dotted line is there its not a complete line that which is a visual whichwill ensure me that i have completed the required tasks no by the dotted line do i have completed four assessments so the dotted line is because you have not assessed the twenty four of the csu moodle sees that you were given a bucket of twenty four in the bucket were gone twenty four and you have taken only four out of it although model does not clearly understand that these were mandated by the workshop team that you need to do only four now this is a small model bug which the other team was trying to so as have already told this assess assigning of a more is a is perfectly valid because it gives you more exposure but you have to do only four
