this activity will talk more about these a levels and other things to morrow you have been already assigned three videos for tomorrows session so session one tomorrow is completely about how to align the learning objectives with appropriate a technology tools what is important to notice that have only used three key concepts so all my videos are related to these three concepts now guidelines for video selection first you can check the national repositories they are entitled and petals youtube channel you dont find any content in this there are international repository is like we are commons open courseware consortium or open learning initiatives which have courses free courses online courses and if you dont find your content over here then look into the video standard video repositories ideally you should filter for creative commons license so with your youtube search or a vimeo search you have an additional component called filter choose this filter and select the creative commons license it is important because some of these videos have copyrights and if there are some copyright violations you may be legally obliged to pay some financial compensation that you me the party a whose video has been put up they may file a case against you so in order to avoid all these that is why we always insist on this open educational resource all these are open educational resources are particularly the we are acid w and oily so the moment you create a creative commons license for your resource thereby you reduce the legal complexity in sharing your content that you create so go to youtube garage youtube education there is a vimeo vimeo also has an education channel and if you dont find any of these there is worldwide web ah there is a site called edutopia which has a list of open education resources websites you can even look into that a normal google search for open education resources in your subject and that is why this key concepts are important these may be the search terms that you put up in the youtube search or the google search some more guidelines to keep the length of the video not more than ten minutes there are empirical evidences are with says that shorter the video greater the engagement if you find that videos are too long lets say you find in petel video which is of one full class are what we would want is split the topic into multiple videos so provide timelines where the videos can be split and chunked one more guideline are the videos are ideally select videos which have both narration and text so that concepts would be clear to the students so this is what you have to fill the main video source you oral provide the you are lower here the license what kind of license is it if it is a copyright a specific copyright then you have to say that it is a copyrighted video and you can map each concept with the appropriate video segment she can provide the start time end time and duration in minutes so this will help you in shortening the videos and at the end of it provide the total duration of the video so if you look at the example that have filled you can see that i have shortened the you are so ive given up did not tell why you url so that it is easy to remember
