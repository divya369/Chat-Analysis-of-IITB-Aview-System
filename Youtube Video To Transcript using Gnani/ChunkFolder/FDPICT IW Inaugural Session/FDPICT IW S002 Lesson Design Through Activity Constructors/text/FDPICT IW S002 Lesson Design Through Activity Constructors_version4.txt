ah the license is easy by essay with reuse aloud and have mapped each of my key concepts with the video segments so i had a total of forty five minute video skype looked at a complete session lecture session by a other instructor and have actually split into videos so none of my videos are going beyond seven minutes initially it is very hard to find smaller chunks so porous starter this is advised but as you go proceed as you gain expertise it is important that you reduce the video length two summer around four minutes youtube vimeo all these sites also have these are filters where you can select short medium or long videos short video as per youtube and vimeo is something which is less than four men are medium lengths a comes in we knew it is approximately ten minutes and longer videos are greater than ten minutes so er guideline while you do a widow selection is select chunks which are not more than ten minutes initially another important thing so if you actually look at the videos that we have posted in iety bombay eggs every learning dialogue video is followed by a learning by doing activity and you can see they were like two or three learning by doing activities associated with a video and each of these assessment activities are aligned to the learning objectives and are at lower levels so it will be some content which was already discussed the levels of questions is not more than apply so it would be either simple recall maybe a little bit about understanding what the instructor said or what the video sent at the most it is application like for example we would have given scenarios there is this flip classroom scenario eh this is the flipped classroom scenario be which one is better so these are only application kind of questions that we have asked you so again we would recommend you to follow the same it is important that there is some amount of assessment strategy that is aligned to these out of class segment and you can put your video plus assessment the total duration should not be more than one lecture hour so over here learning objective what is the assessment strategy expected duration in minutes and if there are some additional instructions you can provided if you look at the example for each of the learning objective that have provided i have provided the assessment strategy and have also provided are the instructions so the total activity durations thirty minutes for the expected duration is thirty minutes and this along with i had another thirty one minutes for my video watching so total is one hour one minutes that is fine it should be around one hour you should not do not exceed more than one or are you have already looked at this there is something called inclass segment where you have to decide what the active learning strategy yes make sure that your in class segment contains activities for effective learning by this we mean active learning strategies in active learning strategy the student will go beyond mere listening copying of notes or execution of prescribed procedures like problem solving coping the what the instructor salt in the boot students are required to talk as you did during your pair per phase
