you will have to complete the inclr segment of the slip classroom activity constructor a during todays lapses which comes in the afternoon are what will do now a jacket a flipped classroom activity construct itself survive enabled the download this presentation so you can also download it within your arses arm in the lab in the afternoon will focus mostly on the out of class component in the next half an hour or so will actually focus on the in class components which you have already seen to some extent in the last one week so to begin i just use this activity constructor to help you format or organize the activity lets go to slide four so the first part of what you need to do now is to actually get ready get primed to create a flipped classroom design for one of your own courses that will be teaching in the coming semester or one big goal for us for this faculty development program is that you not just learn about these new techniques or get familiar but actually create materials which are bound to be practically useful for you as soon as possible when we run this course during the semesters we actually ask the participants to work with a topic that they be teaching the following week go implemented comeback and give us feedback so that may not be possible now but at least we want you to create assignments that you use very soon so inorder to do this the first thing you will need to do for these activities find a partner if you look at the next slide slide five you have to fill in the topic chosen for the activity the course the domain target audience you jpg which year affiliation and so on so you must try very hard to find somebody from the same broad domain and try try if possible at all to find somebody who teaches a similar course the closer the topic for you and your partner is then the easier this activity will be so quickly just check around in your remote centers and try to find somebody with whom you think you are able to write a common set of fa responses for the slide for the topic and so on so would give me about two minutes to do this get up walk around ask people a same domain definitely and preferably cim course this is a pair activity and then two pairs will join and do some more things to you you cant work on this individual as soon as you find a partner please fill up this introductory slide so write down the rapid course domain you can actually go bottom up whats the domain you can you dont have to put the affiliation right now but whats your domain whats the target audience course and so on and start filling out this introductory slide because this sets the background for both the lab this afternoon as well as the up coming activities so currently you can write it in your notebooks if you do we actually are when alton the slide so make sure you write it in your notebook and find people from similar dimensions were in the same or more center and you might be familiar with other participants over there ill be quite easy we expected it would be easier full at a broad level find people from seem to me we really hope that you take advantage of this surface to face part of the blended course during the online sessions your all separated in time and distance your working at homes or offices on individual pcs or laptops so now that your physically together with somewhere between five and maybe even a hundred participants in your are simplistic advantage of that
