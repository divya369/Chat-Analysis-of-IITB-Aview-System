write and reflect as you did in your thin face and pair fees and express their thinking as you did in your share face it has to be the activities have to engage the student in higher order thinking skills so if you happen to look at the pros and cons analysis activity that you did in the morning it actually there were some trigger questions and you had to think a lot more than mere application of these quests you had to completely analyze what the flipped classroom strategy he was about and identify one pro and one con and then discuss with your participants so this is what you mean by higher order thinking it goes beyond mere application you have to do some amount of analysis you also had to do an evaluation which strategy was better or sometimes they may be creation level activities but not always typically in engineering problem solving they are design are problems which can lead to the street level activities another important guideline ensure that students get feedback on their work either from peers or you so during your pair face you obtain feedback from your peer and during share phase as instructors we looked at specific questions and comments and we provided our feedback as a summary and that is also another important point ensure to provide summary that connects out of class and in class activities so remember what we said about the entire exercise so be had obstructed the entire exercise of flick classroom that we have done till now and connected both the out of class videos and the inclass prosand cons analysis activity so you should do similar oduce a summary in yourown flipped classroom strategy so that students understand clearly why the out of class activities are important and why the in class activities are important and how they are connected so a inclass activity design again you start with the learning objectives and key concepts so in this example the learning objectives have been stated another important thing both the learning objectives are at analyze level the key concepts also vary over here i am looking at real world problem solving virus in the videos it was about simple expressions then if you see another important is the activity design you have to state the active learning strategies that your going to do its not just that within the active learning strategy what the teacher is going to do and what the student is going to do across the entire loan strategy and finally you have to justify why the above active learning strategies truly active we have to give specific reasons as to how the student go beyond mere writing a listing or to lecture and although things and have to specifically say why this activity is going to engage them in higher order thinking if you look at the example that is given are the active learning strategy that is are in the example have used the active learning strategy of think pair share as well as a peer instruction have actually mentioned what each of the strategy is going to be useful think pair share for real world problem solving and concept clarification we use peer instruction so are these are peer instruction strategic questions now i am just explaining the tips strategy because you have already come across the think pair share in other video first we provide the premise or the real world problem that we want to tackle over here
