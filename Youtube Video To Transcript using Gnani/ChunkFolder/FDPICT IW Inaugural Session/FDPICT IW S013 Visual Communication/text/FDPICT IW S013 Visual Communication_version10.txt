we wanted you know like i have a downloaded pun people long back i dont know the credit how can i get credit so the question has done okay so i will repeat the person you are saying that you have downloaded some powerpoint slides from internet and you dont know the source of that is it correct so how will you give credit for that presentation the website wherever you have downloaded from is also one of the ways you can referred me back so if you have downloaded from for example slideshare you will come to know that it has been uploaded by ex login name you can refer to that name and that is also good enough because sometimes people will anonymously a put up some content at that time you have to refer to the website but when you refer to it you have to say in bracket as seen on swine so date on this website that is would ideally you should write to the person who has uploaded and ask their permission on an email that i would like to use certain slide from your presentation for this purpose can you approve this usage and if they approve then you can use it that would be nice otherwise you have to re create this and explain it in your own words and then use the content thats what we have today for my slides you are free to use it because i have released the slides in open source under a sea biwi essay so which means that you can use by slides and you can but you have to further release the slides also in the similar licence and give attribute to the person who has created that is me but also relieves the slides in the similar license model so that the the flow continues of open source content creation and we are anyway going to talk about we are in the in the same sessions so this is one way of doing it polymer college of engineering our cushion up would be about a presentation being made pond puppet like michael very more and more can he plot or either mathematics probability is that what we are to take while making the presently hell yeah i have understood the question like this are the question the gentleman is asking is that you have showed me the presentation about communication skills so that is okay but what with if i have a presentation to make on microprocessor or something on algorithms or some biotechnology subject where there is lot of technical content involved and there is no liberty of like what you were using various colors and fonts and all that we dont have that choice so precisely sir what you have ares is very correct and a the the thumb rule still goes in the same manner if you look at the video which had a posted on moodle it shows that use of minimum number of fonts and minimum number of colors and using the grid lines in order to have a well designed layout of the slides adds to a clearer communication any which way whatever the content in arm in the store so i would like to give you another example if you read a novel especially english novels then you can see that they are all printed in black and white there is no color there are no images there is hardly any sketch there but still you can read that infact lot of people tell me that they love to read the novel but they hate the movie when it is made so imagine the situation from that novel they upgraded
