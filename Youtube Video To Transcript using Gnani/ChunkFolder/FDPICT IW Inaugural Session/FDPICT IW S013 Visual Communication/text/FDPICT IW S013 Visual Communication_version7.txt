slightly different than my maps not majority of a difference but visible difference is like what you see here so the connector line between the central idea and the subtopic will also be labeled in shipments and it will have some kind of a relationship explanation so this chooses to do this or this reflects on this so you will write that particular arm summary of that action on the connector lie and that will help you in in reading the concept map very fast thats the idea okay so we have this difference between mindmap and concept map but let me just tell you a couple of tools which are freely available some of them are a free some of them are limited in terms of their usage but most of them are free nowadays you have something called free mind and its mine but there is a tool called think bhusan by the way a mugen is the person who invented mind maps and a perfected this technique long time back so the website which he runs is a one of the pioneering effort in this but it is not a completely free but still you can use limited part of it and a okay so we have a certain part of a mind mapping available theyre okay so from plan stage let us go to the execute phase where we want to now that we have the o in ready with us and we have some topics let us see how we can use them are in a more interesting way and at this point i discussed about the use of graphics in the presentation and i think i have already seen this i dont want to spend lot of time on the different type of content will require different types of visuals and the types of visuals are essentially not cast in stone but yeah you can still take this as a reference what i did not cover in that particular presentation was how you can convert some of the text to graphics to make it more meaningful and here is one example and a now you all know this is a relational graphic because it will tell you the quantitative difference between whatever is happening so tables are typically used to explain things and table will be a not much communicative instead if you use a graph of that that would tell you visually okay that the product number three has this ratio as compared to port number to which has a better ratio so all these things can be very clear if you use a graph instead of a table however there are problems in the way people use graphs or tables so for example look at this stage this is about the poverty rates and there are some other four counties are shown here and the percentage of poverty shown in the other call well there are some problems in this table can you just take a minute to think about what is the problem and try to put it up a can you all see the table and what is the problem with the stable year county is repeated unnecessarily it is annoying okay decimals are having a prob right and you all are pretty correct because if you show it like this then it will be much more simpler because you have the decibels all aligned properly and then you can do this in fact you can go away with word count and just say abc here that also will be better even percentage
