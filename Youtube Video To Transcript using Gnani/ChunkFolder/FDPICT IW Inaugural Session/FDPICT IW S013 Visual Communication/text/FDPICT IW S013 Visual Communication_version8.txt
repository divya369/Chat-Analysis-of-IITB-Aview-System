there is a sign is not needed if it is there on the top right okay now look at this graph whats the problematic situation your font size access are not clearly visible okay font size is the issue okay but font size can be a scale is not perfect okay on why exists i think a range in why access is a proggier swathing couple of people are coming up very right and if i change the scale i dont actually have to talk about the value of to fifty thousand if nothing at least here in white to show all these values right so i just reduce the why access to ten thousands and now you know what i can actually see a this particular dip here which was not visible in the earlier graph at all the editors dropdown in nineteen fifty below six how did which was not visible at this very simple and very common problem but most of the time people forget to use these techniques in order to explain what they wanted to say i have also covered about color schemes and a typography but i did not cover the visual effects and appeal part so i had lot of questions from other people about a nowadays with so many presentation tools we have these options of visual effects and transitions and other how should we use that site just wanted to touch base on the topic briefly at least before you be a go hide in the final segment of explaining the activity so when you talk about a presentations so we have these a animated text effects and then we have a this kind of a windows server being used or we have a slides having this door open type of transition there are many boat transitions in fact you have something like a blast and very can see things getting to pieces we have something very popular which is the page curl and obscene umpteen number of presentations using this type of a slide transition you have this venetian blinds which is becoming very common nowadays you have this thread is type of things where you can rotate the boxes and all you have a flying screens in fact the range is really crazy you keep going and you will see that the vital really shock you the sum effect of a light coming up and add some color transition oh the range is really crazy which will make you think oh what was the topic of this presentation we will it all started very are just forgotten by the time am showing you all the slides what was the over topic when we were a starting of this presentation so let just unwind a bit what we wanted to tell you was that whenever you are using a presentation transition especially are in impress remember this that you want the audience to take your message what are your time to come he wanted you want them to take away the message but you dont want the audience to be taken away by the message that is what your objective at all therefore the simple impress guidelines are but dont overdo anything office over transitions overcolor over font usage over of everything will create a chaotic situation and that is what i think you can remember and like in my earlier presentations even this slide has a green dot which means that this is the guideline slide and you can use this slide as a guideline slide which you can just compress all by presentation slides to one presentation and keep them
