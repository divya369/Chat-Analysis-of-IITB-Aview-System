that is why we need to see how we can make that outline as interesting as possible so that people would be able to communicate and see whatever is happening and then communicate back to us right so in order to get that position we need to stress upon the plan phase very much and one of the techniques i use most of the time is brain storm now in the brainstorming phase the ideation is very interesting and i dont know whether you have tried but maybe some time or during your next weeks coming weeks if you want you can have a farm a small group and try it out at your own remote centers or within your other peer groups cuz its very interesting to see how ideas can generate at the brainstorming live well i will just give you a couple of guidelines about how to conduct a brainstorming session for that matter so this has to start with anything which comes to your mind so it can start with words concepts ideas whatever you think about the topic you just have to write it down and a you have to just throw them on piece of paper and or a board or a nowadays people are just your post it and keep it there you can just use a plain sheet of paper also you dont have to use a very sophisticated equipment for that and arm you can also ask one of you to volunteer and right on the whiteboard or blackboard whatever is available and just keep throwing ideas but the important point at this stage is that you dont have to be judgmental while doing this so it is very important that you dont decide to discard idea or to keep idea being judgment no idea should be discarded at this phase just keep writing later on when youre done with that time slot of brainstorming you can find the relationship between the topics and there if you find no relationship or a certain point which is written they can discard it but not at the time off when people are suggesting for example there is a room of a having five or six people were brainstorming on a particular idea and theyre saying certain a points to be added the person who is writing he or she should not comment right away by saying oh maybe this is slightly farfetched or maybe this is not connected to this so maybe we should when you should avoid these dont take such a judgmental call at that stage just keep writing them after your done with that and with time we put a time limit so that we dont go endlessly on that and after that just try to find out relationship between the so what are typically the points which will go the introduction what are typical point which is about the problem or related work or the solution a proof something like that then you should be able to generate a flow out of these buckets which you have collected while based on this the interesting idea and one of the tools in order to make this is called my dads so mind maps will help you in categorizing and analyzing the particular topic of throwing up ideas and without any hierarchy so to see why i am saying that is because mindmap doesnt tell you about a hierarchical structure so it is everything is thrown at one point and then you can just decide they are collateral based on the audience you are going to communicate so for example there is the audience which right now when im talking to you all you all being teachers i will re position my presentation
