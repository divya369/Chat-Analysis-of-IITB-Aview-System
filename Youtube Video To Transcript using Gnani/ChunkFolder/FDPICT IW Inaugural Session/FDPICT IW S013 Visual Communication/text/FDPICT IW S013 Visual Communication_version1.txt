yeah its small size font people are giving comments about the type of problems anything else smaller frontier i got back and a background color is is horrible right ardiss no contrast correct so somebody is pointing out different things right unable to read so these are two problems how many people find that this position of the logo is also not very correct it is chopped from the top item on the logo should be seen complete and you should be able to read it right then how the people are scared of this a hundred and thirty seven slides like this can you withstand such a presentation for so long its not correct right here somebody from gray mentioned it is not correct therefore we cannot read it as it is horrible so i was joking actually i wanted to show how bad presentation slides can really ruin the content therefore i deliberately started with a bad slide all of you can you read this slide now how is this light so i am going to talk about use of text and graphics in most of the documents well i am not restricting this only presentation what you make in slideshow format or any other format but in general are at the very early stage i would like to acknowledge the contributions in this presentation done by doctor kintaro a he was ahead of microsoft researchers at the time when i met him and i saw this great presentation what he had used in this talk i requested him if i can borrow some of the slides from his presentation which he happily agreed and therefore i am able to use them this is important please note this point its okay to get slides and ideas from people you love too but at the same time dont forget to acknowledge their content this is one way of doing it lets go ahead so whats so much big fuss about the font whats so great about use of what i dont how many people have read this article a year back i think a indian student spoke to the us government and told them that if you change your font your official font of your government is times new roman by the way they said that if you change that font to garamond which is shown down below then you will save four hundred million dollars every year a wise that it is just because the toner required to print the times new roman content versus garum on content is drastically different and you can see the results onscreen ricky the garamond font is thinner and thats why uses less tuna but will you agree to this decision of course used government agree to this decision because simply because of the reason that communication is the primary objective of print why do you want to print you want to print because somebody should be able to read it now you can easily see onscreen that garamond is less readable as compared to times hurom so at the cost of four hundred us dollars if the officials are not able to read what is printed with no point in saving money therefore importance of font is in its readability what is so important about design for example see this particular slide where research analysis is a comparing two groups i have no doubt in terms of the authenticity of the data data is perfectly fine then whats wrong its hardly communicating anything you cannot make out what is being told
