handy so that he can utilize it whenever you are in trouble all want to solve something okay so based on this we can just have a look at the very famous debate of form and function what is a form is how do you show the message and what is the function what exact isms so for example i ask you that my message or my product i want to inviscid is a bunch of bristles to clean or apply then what could be the the solution for that what what would be your answer what should be the form of that if the function is of a bunch of bristles to either clean or to apply something what would be the form you would recommend any just type in your answers for that reason i ask this question it can be brush by the way which rush could this be people of the same brush after even after another but yeah can you be more specific you cannot be specific because i have not given you the context and thats why all the answers are ringing in the zone of just a brush because women as a bristles and a cleaning you remember a brush right now depends on the content very correctly said by college of engineering in good to add that it depends on the context i suppose i give your context well so i give your context that i want something for teeth something for face and something for people know what will you use for teeth obviously you will use the toothbrush i and what will use for face that would be be shaving brush and was of the women in the audience used to be the answer that they would use a makeup brush which is also correct a and a fight of our paper or a wall or something then that would be the painting rests also depends on the context that the same product has to be redesigned in order to satisfy the requirement of that particular surface that is how exactly we should take our decision in terms of presentation in terms of graphics in terms of colour everywhere depending on the context we should take a call off what we are going to use therefore its not that one is more important than other both are important but if you give less attention or inadequate attention to either of them then you will not be able to communicate properly on the other hand if you give excess attention then it will lead to a complete chaos and that is what we should avoid always therefore the content and is a very important and thats why it has a green dot the content for the given audience should govern the decision of choosing what visual your going to do use what design are able to follow and what strategy you are going to apply so it also depends on for example the moment i am teaching or am using a view when i should know that strategy should be of using the chat which is available here and then i can interact with you all images so depends on the audience how your going to conduct your communication skills are tested in such condition very much i would like to stop here for this particular topic and i would like to a now tell you about the activity you are going to do today and are in between if there are some questions i would like to take those questions please
