i wondered how many bullets we should have ideally in one slides how many words it should contain the question was is there a standard about how many bullets should be there in one slide i so i had answered this briefly in a one of the r slides oh use the six by six route or the other should be more than six points on a slide and they should not be more than six words in each point of these things are more than six words makes it very verbose and people are not able to remember it right this is what a very crude level of guideline can be used although they can be slides were occasionally you are forced to use some seven points probably if your topic talks about seven important issues related to something when you may have to add seventh point but that should be a rare according to a researcher which is given at the bottom ah they say that a human cannot remember more than six points if they are bombarded on today so therefore avoid more than six points on a slide and within the site also it should not be having more than six words at that time write thank you very much have good lunch and activity after this i see you tomorrow at nine thirty air
