please consider a scenario that somebody threw your students have watched this video yep dunnock a session and support there are some concepts which have not yet been clarified or there are some additional concepts that needs to be clarified even apart from the video so consider a case like that and then start creating this video so it could be either a related topic or a completely different topic from what you did yesterday so ah the screencasts what it does or what should this videos it is essentially a video so this is one example so there were a this is a simple example of a using recursion so again this is something witches are related to computer science engineering abbott please ask a people who are not familiar with the domain please note what functionalities of the screencast you have used so it is only to get an idea of it there is some audio narration which explains the topic there is a continuous light movement and the writing on slides so they use the pointer so for example if you see and using this pointer right now so if you recorded this pointer movement is also captured so all these things get captured so only after noodles do not focus too much on the content that is being discussed but note the various things that this particular video a provides it is a youtube video you can directly watched from a ura remote center so points to take care while creating video it is same as what you did for selection of video over here but you have control so keep the length of the video to five to ten minutes this is because it has been found that shorter videos are more engaging the previous example if you look at it it is a bit long but since a one of the research scholars over here created for a lengthier self learning session there were specific activities it was chung done specific activities were given from that if the topic is too big for a single video ten minute video then split into two videos if youre presenting animation since you have a using a desktop or when youre presenting the animation it is better to use audio narration along with it rather than text so if there is text and video together they will be some cognitive load on the learner also over they try to use audio as far as possible and itll make the content a acquisition so the information acquisition much more easier now tools for creating a classroom videos there are several technology tools that can help you create a videos the tools that you can use berry based on operating system of your computer some of the common tools camstudio camtasia jing screencast o matic these tools have different features in terms of operation usage look and feel and everything so over here youll be eggs a using screencast o matic and record my desktop so screencast o matic is for windows users and record my desktop if youre a linux user so for windows users explore the screencast o matic tool is available for download over here there is also video tutorials before starting your rub a screencast do look at the video tutorial that is the browser should have the adobe flash player plugin enabled to watch the video or play with various features in the stool create some sample videos so at your neighborhood this is very important whatever you create today or just make sure that an internal peer review happens so even if somebody from a different domain then you can show it to the men ask opinions about have you used audio narration correctly have you used the pointers correctly we use the features of the tool correctly all these things you can discuss with your peer regardless of the dummy because essentially does the same activity that is going to happen you are going to record a desktop for linux users the record my desktop is available at this particular site there is a video tutorial are which uses record my desktop also after recording so this file has to be converted from ogilvy format to eiffel whee you can use this particular command in your linux command line so all these yellow slides are the places where you have to fill so yesterday we had pale yellow or here we are using much more raw what is it visible yellow which is your normal yellow first you have to write the subject and topic subject mean the courts offer which you are creating the screencast so if your not done or any screen cast before so this is just to asking you whether you have done a screen cast or not if yes please mention the topic and if we can provide us the links are a and also the software said abused then it would be really helpful so creating video for your own course even before you start with video the first step is that you have to ride the learning objectives the learning objective should a usually at a lower cognitive levels you have to also mention the cognitive blooms a revised blooms cognitive level of each of these learning objects so creating video for your course at the third step is planning should you require some amount of planning before you start recording so list down the main points within the topic that you want to cover yesterday we saw something cordus a key concepts so similarly over here you know down the key points that you want to cover within your video you want you can also draw concept map of the topic so if people were familiar with the concept map they can also draw a concept map in this place a please note that the main points are written so that you can plan your video bell to achieve best results it is recommended to prepare a detailed script mentioning what your going to say and when you are going to say these are known as visual cues so when you actually go and record a good screen cast it is very important that you create a script first for yourself and then start recording are creating supporting material so sometimes video alone is not sufficient you may be providing them with slides or some books reference books although things so if youre using some of the show if it is a pity a which is being recorded do mention the supporting materials that you are going to use along with this particular screen cast then what you have to do us steps five to eight so a screencast is typically a screencast of a powerpoint slide so open the powerpoint slide which want to use while explaining the concept then opened the screen cast tool and select the screen area accordingly start recording explain the topic orally use and using the pity once you finish explaining stop the recording and save the video in your system now uploading the video tutorial once you do this you can go to youtube and uploaded or some filesharing site lacks even a dropbox or google drive that also would be fine enough but what else to do is after you upload and save it you have to just provide us with the league do not upload the video into assignments currently the file size that is a supported are two ambae so most of your videos will not be a
