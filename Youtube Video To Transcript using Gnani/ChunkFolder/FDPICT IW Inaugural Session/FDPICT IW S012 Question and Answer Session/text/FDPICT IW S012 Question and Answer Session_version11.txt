we are doing research on improving moocs the learning will be better it can be translated to other languages it can be shared with overseas countries it can be offered again and again so there are many advantages in in moves that we should go towards books so we have a uti barbeques of course we strongly believe that we should continue with our live interaction also that is why even though we dont have it fully for this course we do offer it and if it is because of the titan kitty we are able to talk to each other in person although at a distance ride we can see each other you can see what a short time varying i can see how many people are sitting in your classroom and a many people are sitting in the front row amelia in the back row armani ladies are their armani ladies are asking question so on and so far we are able to find all this and of course you also get to see whether we start the thing in time and whether our mike is okay a lot of lot of nice things out we field the questions and how do you ask a question so they are there is a lot of learning that happens in a in a synchronous interaction what we are doing here is synchronous interaction i supposed to let idiva makes books which are mostly a synchronous titan katie was completely synchronous but it is very expensive so we are going towards art mostly a synchronous through books but we have little bit of synchronous that allows us to see each other at least once in awhile okay so a because of these reasons we need to have too because high tiber makes has its own way to assess do projects or whatever other moodle has its own moodle was used a tytn kitty until all the features become available in edible eggs i assume that you have to do both i hope i have answered your question the money minimise suzukis from artsy anyone to senate as deum institute of technology virginia i have a question and we are actually a lot of resources are available in a womans apartment a how to guarantee or who will guarantee the quality of deserve educational resources so good question this question is about who will guarantee the quality of the courses available through a voice so i will give an extreme example a yoda heard of wikipedia wikipedia has millions of pages all created by contributors okay now it is proven if i did it it got rude about fanad mistaken about three to four years ago that any mistake that comes into wikipedia gets corrected within nine minutes any mistake any mistake in any one of the million pages millions of pages gets corrected within nine minutes why because they are so many people were also check your going through because they are so many people using it every page gets used every page gets corrected every page gets commented upon and so on so that is a example that we should always keep in mind that should be the method that we should go for and if a lot of people use it comment on it corrected voyeur will become better occurs we are off a from that ideal
