i do this by dubbing only the spoken part lucky of course one can ask what about the screen you have everything in english we said let it be in english because our children want jobs in indian industry and to get a job and knowledge of english is very useful let them use normal computers let them not demand devnagari keyboard because how many people with devon agree keyboard experience will get jobs in it industry how many of them will get job in this years infosys wipro and so on the cadet use normal computers they would use normal keyboard normal screen so we said we will dub only the spoken part everything else will be in english because we dub the spoken part once again into alternative languages the spoken word is extremely important to us so we called it spoken tutorial light spoken tutorials or have three important things that an ordinary screen cause may not have what is it first of all spoken tutorials are created for self learning we go through so much effort you seen the processes involved in creating spoken tutorial so they put in so much effort that it is suitable for self learning no other screencast created tutorial claims this but we claim it that is one major difference second difference we dump them into all twenty to indian languages nobody else can claim that ours is the largest collection of ici and software and whatever you see on the computer available as instructional material in indian languages we have about five thousand six hundred tutorials we have hundred and twenty in sanskrit we have very large number of reasonable in nepali closed to foreign debt in all our twenty two languages so how many other projects can claim this is the second one the third one which is equally important is that if you go through youtube you see lots of videos but then it is very difficult for you to download them and not saying that you cannot but ordinary people like me cannot download of course there are experts a deity who always say i know how to download but then i have to go through extra effort to download on the other hand understanding the difficulty of our students in getting bandwidth most of our children dont have access to bandwidth just imagine in a lab potty people learning literacy tutorials and everybody is downloading directly from the internet directly stream what will happen to bandwidth infact i would claim that even in haiti which has quite a good band with our system will collapse forty people downloading streaming in parallel videos ride itll happen in every college okay where as a result youtube based videos which are also created using screen cars or not suitable for instructional purposes of course the other problem is in youtube you have them in a haphazard manner whereas we say here is the specific sequence win even number the one two three and we go to any one we say look this is the prerequisite and we say open this video we want you to use the side by side method sidebyside method means supposing the video i open as a file you should also be able to open otherwise how can you practice side by side i am telling that every command demonstrated in the video should be done by you to be reproduced by you so i wont
