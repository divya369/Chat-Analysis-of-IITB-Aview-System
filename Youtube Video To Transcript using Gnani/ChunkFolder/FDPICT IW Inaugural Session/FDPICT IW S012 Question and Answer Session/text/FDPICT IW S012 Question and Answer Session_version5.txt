choose from that lot as our faculty members who can of course promote this activity even more vigorously who can admit many more people as prehistory candidates so in view of that its an excellent question so i would say the term urban thing is to look at our education technology research there are people whose names are listed here i would say that i would urge you to go to the e a webpage and look at the a the profiles of faculty members who are listed there look at some of their papers go through the papers for example i shared one paper with you on solomons arm effectiveness study with a low cost affordable laptop okay so you can actually see how a study is conducted what kind of in life you would write a paper then there is a reason for doing that study which is typically explained introduction background work then you have research questions what are the questions we want to address and how do we go about conducting the study how does one ask questions how does will prepare a questionnaire so that it is acceptable offer example in the paper that i shared with you there are two tables there is one table called likes another table called dislikes but i didnt ask them separately these are the reasons you like this computer tick tick tick tick these are the likely reason why you dislike the computer tick tick tick i didnt do that because the problem is what is the guarantee that they actually read the question and answer what do they say strongly disagree tick tick tick strongly agree tactic without even reading that kind of answer is not accept the you need a mechanism to find out whether the answer is reliable whether people who are answering the questionnaire or giving consistent answers so how do we do that we mix the two so for example because of this reason i like it agree strongly agree disagree whatever semantics one essay because of this reason i hate this computer so these are mixed so if somebody says ticks everywhere the neuro that that person is in the not serious through the vagina and survey so these are some methods that you must follow to make sure that the questioner itself is consistent okay so he can see in every step of that work there are issues i needed to address them okay if you want to work in this area research methodology is a course that is offered if im not mistaken i te bombay has already made it available we have already offered through yakima bags i would suggest that you go through this um if you want to participate in i feel kind of work if you want to do in they say we are creation and validation that it is good not good i told you about creation spoken tutorials creation of a textbook companions live migration okay i would want you to become passionate about for example open source software because it allows you to a player on with it it allows you to open it
