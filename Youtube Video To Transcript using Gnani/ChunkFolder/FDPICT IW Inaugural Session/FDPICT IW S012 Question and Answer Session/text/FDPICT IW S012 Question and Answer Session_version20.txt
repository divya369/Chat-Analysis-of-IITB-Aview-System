and especially schoolchildren for example so what is this project look at this planetarium yodo go to a planetarium show is typically about forty five minute show where you go into these and there is a big dome and they turned the lights off and then you see the whole sky rocket and then you have a somebody who comes and explains here is the consolation here is the star and so on and so forth they talk about it but it is available to a very few people so we thought why dont we build open planetarium using real sky ride using real sky so what is it so the idea is that this there is this software called stellarium ride this stellarium is open source software it knows all about the sky it knows the entire configuration it has billions of stars and so on and so forth right now this stellarium knows ino supposing it is calibrated so you are in this particular city you are in this country are you on the northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere whatever it is the moment you do a calibration salieri knows exactly then in an in home in the planetarium show that i talked about there is of a divine minute script somebody says lets go here and sold similar script can be created in installation right then ill say go to let see the star at this point at this point means what you have to look at it at a particular angle from wherever you are so we have a laser pointer and that is connected to a stepper motor and this software gives instruction now change this and then you see the light of course it will happen only in a dark sky a so ill not be seen in a cloudy sky but in a dark sky which is their most of the time and in all small places it may not be sky is not visible in a big city like mumbai chennai buddy hugo fifty kilometres away sky is dark and you can actually see the star and then the us has fucked itorial comes on he tells the story in marathi stools tells a story in tamil hindi malayalam a nepali cassie bordeaux and solvents urdu sanskrit whatever language you choose and then you have the thing and then after that thing is done it moves on the script moves on raids of fortify minute script so this whole thing basically we have to come up with a circuit board a stepper motor laser pointer it has to interface with stellarium and the whole thing must be housed at the juneau be outputted in a closed container and the whole thing can be sold possibly for about a thousand rupees okay and that will work with our low cost laptop so every school can afford one every school can afford one any interested school can say hey tonight we are going to do a planetarium okay so people go with her daddy with a blanket and they all lie down in a maidan the their children come with her parents when they could sleep there listen to it and then go enjoy your drink tea or juice whatever is available a drinker but the water i end this whole thing happens just imagine for free every school this imagine what this will do to scientific curiosity just imagine we say that yellow isro is launching this ride our satellite is doing this our forefathers found out that mars will be ready
