the change we need to do in that ips activity or the question is what kind of changes if any do we need to do if the numbers are higher so ill have to think about this a little bit because of the top of my head i cant think of any very obvious changes that one needs to do are the reason is that i see in the think phase every individual is writing usually at that time the classroom a silent because people are thinking and writing on the road its the pair face wear rub this a lot of noise in the classrooms one thing is that please be tolerant of this noise its actually good noise its good because people are discussing their ideas critiquing each others ideas so even in the pair face i dont expect any specific changes from a to be done by the instructor other than seeing that look there are lot more pairs to where you may have to do something different is in the share face thats because how do you get a lot more pairs to participate in the share so there you can try some large group discussion techniques for example you can now invite pairs from the left side of the classroom right side center or the front and back of the classroom so in the shares you have to do some techniques to ensure that most or a large fraction of the classroom is represented you wont be able to get all the pairs are all the class members to participate in the share face but at least you can try to ensure representation from various physical locations in the classroom for the surface that is one possibility and there is one more thing in the share phase that we have tried so suppose you have a problem that has multiple valid answers and lets say these are some obvious or standard multiple answers after the pair face the instructor has posted these valid answers together on the slider on the board and just asked people in the share phase to raise their hands if they answer matched approach be and so on so share is one you to try some things are the other thing that we can try is if you can maybe the pair face go up and down a little bit to try to be more accessible to the various pairs so as you see if there are things you can try there arent any specific rules personally we have tried it in a class of about two hundred or two fifty and its worked its not been that challenging the first two or three time savannah both the teacher and students have had to get used to it but otherwise it has worked even in a class of two hundred center one one one one my question is is there any statistics or condition to be followed to pad the students in tvs are in peoples numb and you you told them you can format it mopar and flickr group if any statistic to be followed to form a structured group ask the question is about pairing and yesterday think weot taken this question again in the think pair share you can form unstructured pairs or unstructured group strategy does not recommend any specific statistics are shown when you are looking at more structured group discussions there are some recommendations i think we will take them up more formally in a two weeks from now but only a guideline that people have suggested is that the groups actually be heterogeneous in terms of a select group sweep more diverse whether its in terms of their academic achievement or in terms of gender and so on because its been found that heterogeneous group actually is able to contribute from multiple perspectives that shes one i can think of but will come back to this point more formally in about two weeks i am one more question whether this methodology induced the students to read books my user area ravana i havent come across any such direct study bird rehab center one zero nine eight my question is regarding here it is activity a the achievers of cricketing outfit declares all begun
