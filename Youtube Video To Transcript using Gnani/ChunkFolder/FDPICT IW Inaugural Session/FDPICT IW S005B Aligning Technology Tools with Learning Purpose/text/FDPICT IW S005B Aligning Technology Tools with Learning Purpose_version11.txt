if they go in a mode that i have already done with the content then how to address this thing the question is if there are some students who are especially the high achievers they feel that i know this content have done it already what do i do in the tips so the first thing that youll have to do as a teacher is to design your tips activity so that is it is sufficiently interesting and challenging and this is not so easy because you also have people who are struggling with the content so dont make the tips is too easy because then the concern you have is more likely to be valid usually if you pick real life application context which are new to all students even the high achievers will want to solve it because its a new context they may know the information or the equations behind it but they may not have solved the problem so the problem itself is interesting they would do it the thinkfree is supposed to be easy to ensure that all students get into it all students are able to start the activity so you can announce upfront that nothing face is going to be easy and off for a short duration but the pears and cherries are when the more challenging parts of the question are there still nowhere in the latter technologies either active learning methodologies and then flipped classroom learning will be almost the most suitable further theoretical oriented company edit this in at in academic reviving the two part donated radical underground is a plus but the bigger the particular idol because a major role when your student going for her criticism but rather it may be but how this tunnel this we can implement further practical oriented subject either it may be the same assessment level learning by dialogue we can follow into subject are we want to implement some other new technology further practical subject in league so the question is immune to phrase what you said in the beginning is a question are these suitable only for theoretical subjects are also for practical subjects and lets let me try to respond in two ways are most of these techniques that weve been mentioning here are for classroom based technique or a combination of classroom and online the techniques we discussed here are not directly applicable in the lab settings it to some extent they are but they are in fact many many more techniques which people have research for the laboratory settings things like pair programming or learning by doing labs active learning labs inquiry based labs so there are several techniques which have been formally a there have been created and tested for the labs what weve been discussing here are focused towards classroom learning but having said that it doesnt mean that these techniques are only applicable for what your calling as theoretically oriented subjects also these terms are very ambiguous so whether you have topics which have real life applications or whether you have topics which are more conceptual in nature more mathematical in nature less mathematical in nature these techniques are applicable for a range of such subjects but the context of the setting is usually the classroom plus online setting these people where it has been implemented and video are where available the questioners are their example videos of the places available i saw that and today morning somebody has posted a video but weve definitely providing learning extension resources for all that we have discussed till now in the coming week so this is a sense we thought that it would be an overload we are not posted much of these videos in the last week now we will be differently posting this video we will post videos of people carrying out tips activities as well as we will post a few research papers which have experiences both
