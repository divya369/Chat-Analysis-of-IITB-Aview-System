the teaching them the love writing skills so that an abstract writing happens the debutant driven students more towards the technical papers because even students are writing a lot of technical papers this is what was one of my experience with java are the students have come a headband and summarize the type of activity in the class and when we asked them to list out everything they just gave it as an abstract so in this way it was helpful so i will i just wanted to tell you that this devious activity can be extended towards a was dragged away and another thing is the essence we are all aiming at this outcome based education and we are talking about daddys accreditations and everything how do these activities really helpers for the assessment of where are the results and everything now this is a concern because when we talk about this outcome based education and all the accreditation boards asking us to project data re assessment technique is really an a putting us into trouble like how we can address this particular assessment when you are doing such type of activities so i just have a quick clarification question before i respond to the second question you would like to know how to assess the topics that you have addressed in these activities is that what your asking or whether you want to evaluate how effective these activities themselves are yes in terms of results algoma cuz when we project the data if we are only confining it to assignments we are saying that when we do this activity we love you mark the assignments in terms of incentives but when were talking about introducing these activities into the curriculum the mapping desio peo mappings which are there in this outcome based the to that extent we want how these so i quit one enemy can do is a bit at the beginning when you design this activities start with some of your objectives whether its a course outcome of the module level or the program level and during the design itself as a teacher you can map some of these outcomes to some of these activities okay so this is gods will this disturbance much before you go to the classroom so and this is something you can actually show in your raw document in your mapping document that its not just the lecture component or the some specific assignment which is being mapped to an outcome but each some of these activities are directly being map to the outcomes that is on the frontend and the other thing is indy in any of the exam sluts especially if you have some internal evaluation so you can include questions which you have actually done within these activities so then you have a mapping between the activity and the exam question uyuni this two way alignment right objective activity and activit exam so keep the activity as your center and do this mapping before you do your design itself this will be related to constructive alignment results exactly mohammed and dual front you can recommend accredation boards for remapping for sin do outcome we will try we will try to ask professor father getting he has some say in the words we will recommend all of the sbc the thing is the reason we are recommending these activities is that there is years and decades worth of evaluation and research results behind these activities so its not something that we are coming up and saying that okay to this tomorrow there are scientific experiments done some of them are even controlled experiments they have been done in a variety of context that means different subjects different topics some are from western countries and some are even from indian situations so over a range of contexts subjects people are there have been several experiments done that show that such activities actually lead to better engagement a better learning or whatever the goals and most of the things or all of the things we recommend actually sits on this whole foundation of results as well as theoretical reasons why we are recommending them
