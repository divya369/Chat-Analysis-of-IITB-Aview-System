home india and from other countries where people have tried it and they have shared the research results thank you for the suggestion center one zero nine three mom as you suggested that we should be addressed before the classroom to ensure that students are watching the resources before the classroom so should the result of the tweets be used as a summative purpose okay so the question relates to the quasar that as part of the out of class component are firstly the squeeze is something that you can do the squeeze in two different ways you can either have some short quizzes that students submit online before coming to class touch one way if you haven a learning management system or something equivalent or you can actually have a short quiz in class in the first five minutes of the in class component that also valid method if you use them for many people have used them for summative assessment but if you do use them my suggestion are suggestion here is to have a short very small a grade associated a small weight is associated with it dont waited very highly if you feel that it is not so you dont want to do it for summative reasons thats also okay but you have to see if then the its a feedback which is more important and see if that is working with the students so either our formative is okay but if its summative then let it hours smaller voltage you may find that term students are likely to be a little more serious if there is some weight associated with it even if with one or two per cent now my question is is where facilitator too fast as well as slow learner how we design tips for both learners to balance the class room environment or the question is how to design appears to address both fast learners and slow learners or no cheevers high achievers and so on are again this is one of the eternal challenges for most teachers here are only some suggestions which have worked for us again these are not rules and you will have to experiment to some extent with your own learners but the things that have worked are the tips he is an application type of problem which has three phases so you can actually have the three phases be of different difficulties we recommend that the think face not be too hard because we do want all students to be able to attempt it there is also the assumption or the prerequisite that students have already gone through a lecture or watched a video lecture or sat in a previous class and they know some of the information needed to solve the tips so the tips is not something that we are using to introduce a material at this point so if you can also make sure that students have this have done the reading or done the watching of the necessary videos that will help and within the tips itself have a range of levels that will help and the third thing which actually works remarkably well is in the pair face what happens is that students are teaching each other so even if you have to students of different term achievement levels sitting next to each other both of them do get something out of the activity also again there are some open questions where are they are good suggestions that people have tried and we will post this question also to the discussion forum center one three five to utterly on to share two point mom one is a question and adonis ive implemented the previous activity in my class i teach engineering chemistry feather was be tech students one extension of this devious activity what i can suggest the since we do this devious activity in the class when we are summarizing all the point and if viagra tudents do put up a write up it would be like
