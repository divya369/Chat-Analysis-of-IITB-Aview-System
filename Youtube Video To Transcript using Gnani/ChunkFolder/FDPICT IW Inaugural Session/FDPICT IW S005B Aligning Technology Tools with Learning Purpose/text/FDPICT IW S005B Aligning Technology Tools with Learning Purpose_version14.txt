the specific phase that is connected to these artifacts during that phase all your participants all your students you should let them focus to the artifact that you want to a show if it is the poster board you should ask everyone to look into this chart or poster and identify a particular mechanism in such an one good idea that comes out of your suggestion is if you bring a chart or a demonstration or an experiment create a question around the experiment to create an entire tips or some phase of the tips which the question itself is about the experiment to watch the experiment and make a prediction as to what will happen or how would you reorganize this chart so make sure that the tips is actually aligned to the chart a demo that you bringing that might help okay so thank you for your interaction
