the past efforts to a relative who they are another set of results maybe looking for some a specific solution for a particular case study in a case of a professional they may be looking for getting reference for patent search activity of a very good thank you so up i thanked all of your broadly got the ideas of others in the second step we look at what do each of them have as goals from something that you have so you just list down for ease of this role so we had a three broad roles and within each broad role you had a some sub roles like peachy student eugene student appears the scholars and so on now for each of them you have to list down a set of goals after you do that you have to prioritize which is the most important thing in each group what is the most important goal for each of them because you will be designing a website which addresses their primary goal you they will have thousand different things thousand different uses of the information you provide what is the highest priority goal for that each particular user so that is what he called us prioritizing the goals so you can do that i will not go through that now lets go to the next step this is the one of the most important thing to understand the current problems what are the problems that each of these people you have identified your identified that they have a particular goal now what does the current pain points pain points meaning what are the problems that theyre facing now before your website is up in accessing this information or using this information currently lets say you dont have a website of which says your research problem but it it is there in some other form so these people whom your identified have a certain goal they want to achieve it either they dont have access to the information that you have or they have the access to it but theyre not able to use it effectively so there is some pain point there some problem that theyre facing in accessing that information so it is very important to understand these pain points and then what you present will actually address these pain points unless you address these pain points you have not achieved your goal of providing information in a useful form otherwise it simply amounts to putting something on the web always we need to think of people thats why i said at the beginning we have to think of people who are these people not organizations not general a bodies but people in those organisations people in those bodies what is it that they want to achieve your identified that but in the process of achieving that theyre facing some difficulties can you make it something easy for them to achieve their goal from what you have so thin
