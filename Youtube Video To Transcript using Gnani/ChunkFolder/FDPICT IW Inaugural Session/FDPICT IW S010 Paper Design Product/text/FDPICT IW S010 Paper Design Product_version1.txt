we can answer only one time reporters two chances we may get high scores other trustworthy are quick about adriana ah but you think in terms of the difficulty level the questions are very very simple recall kind of things if you just observe the video id be right now the reason is last time when we did this for students not for teachers a leg way we do this with students what they do they do it in the group that only four choices my four people sit and guess all the force as if they know what the correct answers so which is the reason there are errors been decided that you keep it at one at a because a very simple its not like vary if we just listen to the video and look at the transcript its more than sufficient to answer most of the crop is thank you thank you out a thank you so this is a behemoth college of engineering bangalore there is no clarity in yesterdays moodle activities that we want to know about that and one more thing is regarding everybodys asking the peer assessment date under those who have not submitted the deadline is over it is not required to give them one more chance because those who made the rapport real effort will be the sufferers i dont think the if the yesterdays the presenter told that will be one more chance for those who are not committed a pious man and those were submitted on time and get the review will not be benefited in this aspect i dont think we should not entertain the portions were not presented on time thank you thank you i will convey your feedback to them normally it is given only once but i think because they are doing it for the first time most of them are not familiar with the sequence of activities involved in peer assessment but will really appreciate your comment and well i respect that sensitivity are normally not be given but just because first time you are doing a appear assessment what can happen as many times they dont look at the example that go directly and so many questions come to us asking which to do first i could not see any screen why am i not able to see and so on i came on twenty fifth the last date i came on twenty fifth but nothing so that it is basically a problem with getting used to the technology and i think once people are familiar it should be okay but definitely even if it is that it will not be there for more than one its the one the first assignment alone i think we will give a little leverage even if they give a submitted the again it is mainly for learning but that not be considered for grading like somebody is allowed to submit the second time but they will not get the grade there lonely be adjust sbiff familiarizing them themselves with the interface is that okay thank you very much so thank you we will start the session for today for about one hour from now we will do what is called as a paper designing of a product i in this case the product is not actually a physical product but a web page okay so beginning tomorrow you will listen lectures on how to design simple web sites for faculty in waterford various tools available on how to go use the stones but before that you need to know why you are designing this product and the how your going to go about it so that is called as a paper design paper design means basically you do everything on paper okay and then later take it on to a software so paper design could be used in many things like if you actually designing a product for example
