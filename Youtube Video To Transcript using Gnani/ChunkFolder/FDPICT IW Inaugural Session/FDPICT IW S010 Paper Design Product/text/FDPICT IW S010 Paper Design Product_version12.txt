so to summarize we talked about paper design of a product in this case the product was your web page of a research problem what we said was we need to articulate the ideas first on paper we discuss with your peers and then you converge on the ideas you identify the roles first what are their goals what are the current pain points and then you design a layout of how your product or a web page is going to address them okay so i hope youll be able to carry out this the afternoon session it is going to be the problem is going to be a faculty profile page you are going to create a faculty profile page design on paper you will then listen to lectures next week starting tomorrow on various tools that is used and then as an assignment you will submit a link to your web page which you have created based on the design you have and some dummy content you may not have their full content now but you can put some dummy content and have the broad layout of the page design okay thank you
