able to complete the work later you can download this presentation and carry out the same steps in the afternoon lab session so let us design on a paper how to put up information on a research problem that you are working now so firstly the broad steps we are going to follow is to do it on a paper so this is what we call us thinking before developing you dont actually go and sit with a software tool which gives you a website but you articulate your thoughts on paper individually and then discuss with your peers in this case appears is the group a group of a three to four that a form the team whose current work on this problem each of you will have their own ideas you have to discuss with your peers and then converge on these ideas so this is very similar to your think pair and share so here it is mainly think and share because its a very small team you just going to articulate first and then converge on the ideas the first step in designing a product or in this particular case a simple web page not a whole big website but only a simple web page the first step is to find out who the audience who is going to consume this who is going to make use of it okay so what will do now is each of you take a piece of paper and start writing down roles who are the different roles roles in the sense is a the a general audience whose country is it media whos got a view the webpage is going to be a student is your current student is a past student future student is at your department peers is a term a people from the journalism or media or is it going to be the ministry or is it going to be some potential employer who is going to look at your web page who is it okay so by role i mean you have to identify a particular set of people so you just list all the roles that are possible all the rules who is likely to consume this piece of information so please take your a pen and paper and start writing down names individually without discussing with others i will give you about five minutes time and then i will let you raise hands and then we will do the second step which is calling out all possible roles so will take about five minutes time now okay so i will ask you to raise hands if youre ready i see only five hands rise wrzesnia keep your rolls ready am just going to ask for just one or two roles for a college so we have dronacharya said we are heading
