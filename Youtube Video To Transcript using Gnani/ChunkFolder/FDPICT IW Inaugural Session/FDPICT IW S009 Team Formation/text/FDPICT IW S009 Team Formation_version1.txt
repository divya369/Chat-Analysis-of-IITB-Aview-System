the centrally in any collaboration there is always an element of voluntary nature of a human be but often such collaboration is prescribed by the need of the organization so staff of a section in office will collaborate also because not just because theyre volunteering to work together but also because they require to do a class of stools on the other hand may work together or may not work together there may be groups and subgroups form who we discuss a particular problem but when the teacher is enforcing a common synchronous events such as a discussion in the class then everybody is required to participate in a similarly if you take educational activity whenever there is a team assignment the team of members is supposed to work together and that is part prescriptive part volunteer for example we often ask our students to form teams now this part is voluntary so they decide which are the people were like minded or who can work together to form a team however once a team is form the teacher will say all right this team shall do this activity this is the kind of nature of the collaborative work that happens in any organized towards the end this evthe we are going to talk about building and nurturing collaborative community which is a much larger vision and much larger thing but as a precursor to that and of course as a requirement of this evthe we are saying that we start doing teamwork right from now so let us look at what is required to be done is for this hefty piece skills first and foremost all of you participating from a nazi are required to form teams a team to comprise two to four participants so they can be three participants but they should not be more than four participants and they should not be less than two participants and more importantly the teams must be of those participants which are participating from a given archive that weiss membership of the team across remote centers is not permitted as far as this hefty piece i would like in fact the first lab session today to be spent on a the team formation and be the work that has to be done by the team this work will be related to the boodle things that you have done there is a site called demo dot date on which each individual can practice i believe we had given this identity of the url to people and many people would a practice that the differences that would in todays lab session you have to work in teams so if there is a team of three people for example all three people should work together in the first session they should work together to do the prescribed assignment on paper in the second session they should use demo dot net and establish whatever is to be required to be done and do that as team let me explain the composition of tiny some more details plus towel each team has to have a team leader this will not be imposed by the hefty pure workshop coordinator but the two three or four people who come together have to choose a leader from amongst themselves ideally the team formation should be such that these team members should be able to meet at least occasionally or once in awhile physically together for brief meeting of course this is not compulsory thing that all people must belong the same city same institution if theyre from different cities are different
