and institutions they can collaborate only using asynchronous mechanism such as emails will prescribe the collaborative mechanisms in more details tomorrow when i meet you again the team to conclude is expected to interact in face to face meetings such as the occasion of this face to face interaction for example and they must also use other asynchronous mechanism they could be a shared server or emails etc what is most important is a team is collectively responsible for the activities that are done by all members the tee so team leader as the representative the team will be doing single submissions the first submission to be done by team leader is the membership of the team itself for example if i am chosen or elected as a team leader by a team of four people then the first thing i must inform the epc coordinates which is my workshop coordinator is that look i am so also these my email id and i have with me these see other colleagues were members so four of us form the team and i am the team leader now this prescription of in what format you should prescribe or you should give the information about your team will be put up on the web on the wood which you can look at when you go to the a site in the afternoon but what is most important is that the exercises that will have to be done by the team have to be done collaboratively i will have a lot more to speak on on the collaboration tomorrow so i have one more slide to show these teams which are form are not arbitrarily form these team shall work not only are the assignment or the lab work today there will also work for all such team assignments in the coming weeks of this every ppi including the final submission that is to me so please remember this team formation is an important activity and once you form a team that team remains the team for rest of the evthe including the philosophy obviously the activities that people will do will pertain to some domain as all of your aware in the first four weeks you already identified domains of work now these domains are the fields of education that we talk of how invested they listed further jingellic slide so these are the domains that have been written here please see that the domains numbered one two three four five six seven eight nine ten have already been listed earlier we added one more domain here which is code numbered zero which says educational technology why we have added this there maybe some teams which instead of working on a specific area of engineering or science or architecture or any such specific domain they might work they might wish to work generically on use of educational technology it could be related to pedagogy could be related to educational technology activity if they wish to do that then they should identify themselves as working for a domain code zero you may choose any domain for the activity today that need not necessarily remain your domain for the other team activities however we would prefer that you and your team sticks to a particular domain forest the work so that you can collaboratively work together to conclude in the first session in the lab session today ugh
