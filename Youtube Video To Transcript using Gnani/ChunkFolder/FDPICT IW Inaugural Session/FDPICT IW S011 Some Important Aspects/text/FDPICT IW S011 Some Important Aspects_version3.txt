i am not penalized i am tempted to do it the second time this is actually part of a generic value system that crumbles if efforts are not made to curb such depth i am not blaming anyone this is a human nature all of us are great optimizers all of us as human beings would write like to try to minimize our efforts and maximize our gains and such temptation sucker for marks among students for recognition or certifications among faculty for money amongst people who are grown up and that is what we call corruption in fact or for fame for whatever reason in fact the entire societal value system actually attempts to promote a understanding that such things are bad at such things should not be done that is the reason why we have legal systems justice punishment etc that is because whatever we dub as bad should not happen if someone does a bad thing there must be at least the weapon the knuckle or a severe penalty depending upon the act and the severity of the app now this i speak generically but let me come back to the academic value which is what concerns us most at this first and foremost all of us should understand one thing about digital submissions which is what is happening in this every ppi and which is what will happen increasingly in coming years in decades not only for every piece but even for teaching that we normally those of you who teach in an environment with reasonable computerized facilities available such as programming assignments for example a nighty bombay they all submitted onlye now whenever you submit anything on lie in a digital form the first and foremost thing that i must understand that if i made a submission that submission remains as a record it cannot be refuted what it means is if i have submitted something whatever it is my own or anybody elses copied whatever if you submitted something when it was submitted who submitted it and what was submitted all of this remains as a record in a server generally far removed from myself so whenever i submit i must understand that it is not for now even one year later ten years later that submission can be examined and it can be established who submitted it when it was submitted and what exactly your submit that cannot be refuted more importantly if such submissions contain text then the text can be auto analyze auto analyze means what i do not know whether your heard of a software called turnitin turnitin is actually a repository of an extremely large number of research paper shell tell you how we use this turn it and it helps us to find out if a new research paper that comes to me contains any paragraphs or similarity with any another previously published lakhs of result you know how we use it sometimes our imtech students or if the students when they submit their internal reports let us sell literatures are now a literature survey is by definition a survey of what others have done but theyre our instructions are crystal clear if you survey somebody essays paper the number one you must acknowledge that person you must cite that persons their main research in the literature survey bug and number two you are required to re phrase the wordings used by that researcher in his or her publication you are not permitted to reproduce it verbatim if you do that youd put it down
