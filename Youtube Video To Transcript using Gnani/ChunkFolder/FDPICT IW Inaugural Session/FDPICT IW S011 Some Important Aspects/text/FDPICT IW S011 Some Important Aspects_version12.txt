then in all such cases we will examine when they have submitted and if theyve submitted just missing the deadline then will consider that and lower what we call the passing percentage so that serious minded people were sincerely up our trying to do something do not suffer and they will get call we agree it is points thank you thank you anonymous college jaipur over to you a question related to an undergraduate degree program and post graduate programme in be tech programme repertoire assignment as well as the laboratorys work in that most of the undergraduate student is generally copy how to stop that first question is that and if we talk about the impact this is another part even the seminar ent of mythic rico air although how much a level of pleasure in these public records even if it get by i authenticate or turnit we caterpie topware term limitation is that beyond that limitation we cannot omit so kindly suggest as a hired made one suggestion to a city which will repeat for all our colleague participants to seriously consider we have found the best bet is that all mps thic dissertation and all be take project reports must be compulsorily put on the institute website there must be publicly available is remember that half the problems that happen in any society is because of non transparency if i submit the name take this and lets have copied your this isn submitted one as mine as long as it remains only with a within a few examiners who are unable to find that copy ill get by and they can merely pass away but revive required to publish that em take thesis and make it visible publicly then i may be worry because if not today tomorrow somebody else may certainly jor el who further guess copied from southern salesperson and this effect should be revoked that would act as a deterrent that is the reason why i mentioned even in my presentation that a digital record is permanent then is non refutable a paper record you can do lot of hanky panky and you may not be able to process so my serious suggestion to all our colleagues to their college administration please make it obligatory that every bee take report every emcee a report every am tech report is publicly available it is available in ai debate of course it often it is available as abstracts but some dives the complete dissertation there only one or two situations where the entire thing may not be public and hell tell you those situations a which are exempted even elite hip hop number one if it is a sponsored project where somebody has funded the project and the intellectual property right is shared with that sponsoring organization then those portions of the em take thesis which relate to the protected intellectual property rights are not required to be publisher yet the remaining part is required to be published but let me hasten to tell you that such imtech dissertations are hardly ten per cent of the total lib tech dissertation and at the be level or emcee a level they are hardly any such sponsored a project therefore there is no excuse for anyone to say my project is mine i will not publish a project which has been assessed as a university submission is a public property must be publicly so
