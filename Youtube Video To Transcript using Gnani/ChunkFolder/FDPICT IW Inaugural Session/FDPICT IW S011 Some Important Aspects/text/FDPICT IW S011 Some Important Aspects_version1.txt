we would expect discussions amongst themes amongst all the parties that is where the knowledge that we gain gets consolidated we can raise some common doubts these could be communicated to eighty bombay or put on the discussion forum and all of us will become wiser through such discussions and interaction that is the reason why we at said right upfront that participation in this critical part is mandatory now it is possible that for some genuine reason someone may not be able to attain either a session after session first of all it should be avoided the reason must be very serious for your not be able to participate and even in such case when when you are not able to participate in this critical part because some genuine reason one you must inform the workshop coordinator at your remote center and inform the itee bombay team of your absence more important than that if for some genuine reason your absent it is your responsibility to makeup for your apps how do you makeup for your absence immediately find out from the workshop moderator and from other colleagues what exactly transpire if there was an activity which was required to be completed during the face to face interaction sessions such as in the labs in the afternoon you are expected to complete them either individually or with the help of remote center coordinator workshop coordinator but you must complete those activities because that is part and parcel of their safety so i hope i am very clear nobody is supposed to miss these interactions it is not adequate that you come sign your presence in the morning and then disappear for the session that is in fact worse because what is expected of you is that you participate and contribute to the discussions that happen within the participants group assembled at any artsy and participate similarly in the labs so i hope i am very clear on this and i hope that if there has been any absence because some genuine reasons if previously the matter has not been reported we do get some i email saying that someone is not able to attain this data that day we presume that the person is taking care of making up for the absence by interacting with the workshop coordinator and other team members if not done so so far please start doing it in case you missed this or the next the second matter is more serious and unfortunately far more unpleasant this relates to assignment submissions as you know the multiple individual assignments were required to be submitted in the first four weeks these where we are assessed individually submitted there are several individual online research which were expected to be done in coming weeks you will be doing team assignments as well as individual assignments for example today press the shutter has given an assignment part of that is a team assignment which will work during the lab sessions today i believe that the team leader of every team is supposed to submit some getaway people desire by scanning two three four pages that you your team prepares and then uploading that as a team assignment that is more for a record of course each members the team should carry these three or four pages paper design and subsequently work individually to prepare a simple website as he has directed that will be peer assessed later add after the assignment from now when i am doing such assignments submissions either individually as a member of the team i have also agreed that all these assignments including for example the course material and other lectures
