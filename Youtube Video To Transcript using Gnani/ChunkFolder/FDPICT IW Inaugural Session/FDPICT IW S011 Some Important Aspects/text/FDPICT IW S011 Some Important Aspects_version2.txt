i recorded lectures recorded interaction etcetera i remember we have said that we will release all of this in open source rival agreed for that and the objective is that the combined learning by all of us is actually made available to a much wider body of kali teachers across the country and perhaps elsewhere in the world this is all good intentions but latency unfortunately what has happened before i tell you what has actually happened in this every pee i would like to comment on a keyword called plagiarism i hope all of you have heard about this world if not please understand the exact meaning of this when a piece of work done by one person is copied by another person and submitted by the second person as his or her own work without clearly acknowledging the original author is termed as pleasure in common parlance we call this copy there are multiple instances when such copying can happen for example students copying answers in an examination or students copy either a complete assignment or a part of an assignment when theyre required to submit it as a part of the course or subject that we teach amongst grownups unfortunately such copying happens when some part to the research were dug by a kali either now or earlier is copied and verbatim reproduced and but it is reproduced as my work now when i do this it is actually copying of a research paper part of research paper copying of this is all of these are examples of plagiarism needless to say such plagiarism is simply not accepted why the temptation occurs to pleasuring so let me put my points all of your aware of this number one i am a student all i am a participant in a workshop like this i do not have time to do the work on my own but i need to submit something within a deadline so i may be tempted then i dont have time but somebody some friend of mine has done something okay since there are four thousand people submitting assignments maybe it will pass away just copy his or her assignment and submit as my own the other reason could be i am unable to do the work myself because perhaps have not prepared have not studied properly but i have a compulsion to submit because either marks are involved if i am a student or a certificate is involved if i am a teacher in our case surely a certificate recognized by eyes it is involved and that could tempt me if either i am inadequately prepared all i do not have time i might think it shallow i will just take somebodys submission copy it and submit when i do so i do it in the belief that one my act will not be caught or no obviously that if my act this court they could be some penalty but i presume i believe that this act may not be the second even if there is some risk of being caught i assess that risk and i say all right therefore thousand people in this every peoria submitting even if they catch so what could be the penalty perhaps likely to be no penalty or perhaps likely to be minimal penalty i consciously decide that i am willing to take that risk and the moment my mind except that race i become prey to the temptation now i am tempted to copy something submit it as my own the first time it happens it is not caught
