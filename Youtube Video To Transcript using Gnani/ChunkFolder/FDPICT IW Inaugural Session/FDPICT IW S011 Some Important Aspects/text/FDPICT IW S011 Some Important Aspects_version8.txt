of course we do we also know that students are clever enough to learn these subjects on their own often however our main job is to motivate them to help them try to get enthusiastic about learning something and still more important job to pass on the right value systems to the youth of the country that is our jaw please note that our students whether you like it or not our spoons old us in some high esteem in fact they actually tried to see role models in us our behavior is taken by them as if its a model behaviour if it comes to be known that we ourselves are so weak in our value do you think our students will learn better value on the other hand if our students are convinced that we are committed to establish and follow good value system then perhaps there is a chance that many students if not all will follow that value system and say yes thats the right way to once again i apologize for taking a lot of your time in this important part of face to face interaction where we have a whole lot of very important and useful things to do but i felt that this was extremely critical i felt that i should not act one way only by imposing the penalties that are normally to be done and that i must offer an alternative for those colleagues who have unfortunately fallen prey to such temptations perhaps for the first time in this episode so i will just repeat this this survey will be put up two to three days later there will be a type be read about four to five days in which your to submit the survey but please remember that those of you been tempted to copy start assembling quietly within yourself all the records which assignment yet copied with you submitted that and from whom your copy will be required to give that those of us who have not indulge in such unfortunate practice of course just have to say look i have not done this and that would be the end of the bat i repeat again if this is done we will not impose the normal penalty such participants are most welcome to continue to benefit from this every ppi there will even be given a certificate of completion if therefore the minimum required marks or grades in the remaining part of the eyes of the courts and of course in the other assignments they have not copied and there is a very good chance because a large amount of such assessment is yet to be done i will conclude by saying ill enjoy this evthe notwithstanding whatever asset but please do reflect prototype said please do discuss amongst your route groups if you have any suggestions to make any observations to make please make them in a generic way not naming any person not showing any disrespect for any individual because we are all colleagues but if you have any general opinions if you have any general observations please do make them because collectively our wisdom should prevail on all of us and later on all the lacks of teachers to establish and nurture great academic well i would like you to get over this shop i am still reeling under the shock have not got over this well frankly i never in my life expected that colleague teachers from other institutions would be tempted to do something i will come out of the shock but
