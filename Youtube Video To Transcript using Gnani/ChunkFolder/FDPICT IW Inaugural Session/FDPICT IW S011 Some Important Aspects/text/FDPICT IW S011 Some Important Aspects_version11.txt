maybe right now i qatifi students wall sit in the lab next to each other but believe me everybody gets you online quiz with a different question every if a set of equations is different for everyone we absolutely no chance of coping in fact in the first lap my students try to look here and there the neighbor and when they discovered that this idiotic professor has done some fancy stuff and everybody is getting a different question they stop looking here and there and started us as a big way so once again sorry for the elaborate explanation but i am grateful that you raise this issue to demonstrate that this can be done a nighty bombay acts in the week when i will discuss the features of moocs platform to demonstrate this i will actually create that ways discussed how such randomization is done in this particular platform and encourage all of us to use such randomization in future thank you once again thank you theresa two more supplements led to further add on to the idiocity what you are already very normally suggested why cant our lab sessions in our lab sessions we can create some questions and send it which can become a question bank are very well said in fact one of the motivations that i had while designing the last portion of the every ppi namely creation and nurturing of collaborative community and also the final submission specification which is a team effort for creating an oh yeah i do have in mind that the open educational resource that would be created by many teams would actually be a set of such quiz questions pertaining to a specific domain or subdomain the last supplement you are coming back your unethical approach i kindly request to encourage those were doing and sincerely and who really have got some difficulties either either in time are especially the technical slag you can kindly consider extending the resubmission especially those have demanded will in time so many of us we could not load utma upload our assignments in time but we missed very marginally the technology can clearly say who has missed wasnt missed you can it that this will encourage those who are doing sincerely to do give some consideration and to give them a second chance may not be for everybody a technology can be well utilized to see who desires and who doesnt have a very good and important point that your mate i have not made any announcement in this regard so our rules as of now remain firm that if you miss a deadline then your submission will not be access i will talk to my colleague whether the submission dates could be defined such that there is the deadline for submission in assessment but if i missed the deadline i am still permitted to submit whether it is considered for marking or not is a different matter but ive a record of all such submissions and as you said technologically i can assess where the people who submitted within five minutes half an hour one hour or one day of that and not ten days later and give appropriate credit this credit cannot be given in terms of marks because we already announced our grading scheme but ill tell you what i propose to discuss with my own cali we have decided that people must get minimum fifty per cent score in all quantitative assessment what i will do is and that is what we do in our relative grading to our students also that if we find a number of faculty members scoring close to fifty per cent but not crossing that fifty percent barrier
