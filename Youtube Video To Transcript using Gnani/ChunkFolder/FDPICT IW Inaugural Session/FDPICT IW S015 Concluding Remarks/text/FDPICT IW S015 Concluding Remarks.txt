an added attraction theyve said that please do it pressure fatigue but we dont have any funds to give you these are the kind of challenges that not only the technical education faces but the whole country place and we have to answer these challenges by coming together and working on arrow so this is the culminating set a weeks for the worst ever historic every ppi which concentrates on this aspect sounds the learnings that we had from this every ppi is that instead of conducting a comprehensive four week equivalent every ppi which takes more than twelve weeks to complete because ten weeks of online activity has to be completed before we have decided that will break this evthe into two parts the first part will concentrate on foundations of high city where will cover all the common technologies and their knowledge in a shorter chamber of a hefty fee equivalent to two weeks we shall mostly be conducted on the second component which relates to the pedagogy of effective use of technology in education will be covered in another hefty ppi which is equivalent of two weeks of work which of course if you consider the online activity it will run for at least five to six weeks with some interaction ab we may not have remote said this is the only places for that interaction right now on the drawing board many of my colleagues are working out the modalities but we are clear about one thing if were to conduct these programs in future to cater to a very large number of professional colleagues tell iety bombay ritish rper alone cannot do this task we will need assistance and help from committed professional teachers were willing to give their time and effort for helping us and that is the reason why we have conceptualized the scheme of teaching associates and wear from these teaching associates will come well to begin with they will come from amongst the two thousand five hundred teachers were participating in the recipe i look forward to seeing more of the passionate people among you were willing to lead this effort with us so that the learning that we have is communicated to a much larger number of her colleagues all across the kitchen i would like to repeat that in this matter of the newly emerging pedagogy on effective handling of i city or greater quality of education is not something hobbies textbooks are available or standard mattresses available all of us are learners people unite the bombay have been more fortunate for having experimented with these things our last five years so perhaps we know a bit more now you know something as you go back to your colleges in practice some of these at least a few of you could become better experts then even as a tip up and together we hope to take this style and technique o greater perfection so that the entire indian education system higher education higher technical education penn suggested the first point i wanted to share with all of the second point is not very pleasant as i had observed a last time that we noticed a few cases of undesirable plagiarism where some of their colleagues were tempted to copy submissions of their friends and submit those submissions as their own and in everything we take these things very seriously a generally dont occur but when they happen the penalty is very harsh i was quite surprised that why such things are being detected from amongst teachers because we are not dealing with student reducing with teachers but then my colleagues told me that part that human being is a human be after all where youre not tempted to copy an assignment when you were a student i said yes i did then when you grow what is the reason why you will not give into that temptation if the chances are bride that you will not be caught so i grudgingly agreed that yes i might fall to the temptation however i still hold that as a teacher we have a greater responsibility to demonstrate higher value and we cannot demonstrate these unless we imbue these valves ourselves to the perfect since it is entirely possible that we might be tempted because temptations occur in life are a variety of reasons that is the reason why i thought of an alternative where i requested people to give a feedback admitting early in case they were prey to such temptation and they mention exactly what they have copied and tom who i was again surprised that more than two hundred people more than two days participants have actually confessed that they were free to guests while i feel sad that there are so many teachers who fell prey to such temptation i also feel now that the same to a hundred people had the courage to come forward and say yes we did that it was a mistake yes sorry will not repeat it believe me my dear friends it requires tremendous guts to admit a mistake to commit a mistake is relatively easier to admit a mistake and to corrected joy complement all those two hundred plus friends wax showed the courage and i am sure that they will never ever permit themselves to be tempted like this in future i would suggest that all others we have not indulge in such practices should know the temptations in life can occur any time not necessarily now they may occur next year they may occur year after that particularly when many of our faculty colleagues are pursuing their research many are working they piously on research work with the research scholars several of our catholic teachers are actually themselves doing bsdi and many others would be soon followed and that is an area where the temptation to copy material from somebody elses work is the treatise you might have heard that very recently a vice chancellor of a university in puducherry was caught doing this plagiarism it was the cat was cat caught last year she submitted her resignation but did not submitted properly shes now been removed forcibly that is the downfall my dear friends that may occur if we fall to such temptation it is therefore very very important that we uphold these values and once again i will say that while i feel sad that so many of our participants were tempted but i feel immensely proud that they had the courage to come forward and say yes we made a mistake and that it will not happen in this context i would again like to mention the importance of open educational resources on which you have had a large amount of discussion earlier couple with open educational resources is the matter of open source the software which permits us to use that software freely modified distributed and therefore i can legally use something which otherwise might require obtaining a license at the cost in the context of open source software i will mention some discussion which happened yesterday i was sitting with my colleague up in front of my colleague mister turner when he was talking about the use of spoken tutorials in teaching people different thing and then there was a question saying silo which is one of the open source software having the same functionality as the well known commercial product matlab many teachers say that our students are more comfortable with matlab we are not comfortable with style and his answer i think was that the matter of comfort comes out of the matter of exposure and the matter practice however if your people and you are comfortable using matlab absolutely no problem make sure that every copy of the matlab that is used by any student on any computer at home or in the lab and by the teacher is a licensed fuck now that is a hard job because many of our institutions are not careful about checking whether the software is actually licensed software or no reason the sense that if we do not respect intellectual property right of others the rest of the world will never respect our intellectual property that picky so in a nutshell you are of course welcome to use any piece of software that you feel is required to do the necessary war however ensure that the software that you use is legal tender if it is a commercial product ensure that you have a license which is properly paid for if you cant afford that license then you must use an open source free software instead i will tell you any stance where this happened not now but thirty years ago when one of the researchers in a company godrej competitors doing research in graphic then was attending a conference in germany and in that not concerns a trade show and in one of the stalls he was shown a particular utility which was extremely good he wanted to see something more eddie says yes i can show you that something more but that requires an additional piece of software i have it loaded on the machine but i dont have license to run the license is only on the machine which is in my lab which is a hundred miles away but if you are willing to spend time i will drive you there show you that and then i will bring you back it did that because he did not have the license to run that software on that page do we inculcate these values amongst our students we insist that no student shall ever use unlicensed software do we do it ourselves very carefully we unfortunately do and that is the national problems not blaming anyone in particular but this problem will have to be sore it is this habit of not respecting the law of the law he says that if there is a proper commercial software it must be paid for before i start using it tempts us to do many other things also copying somebody elses material and passing it on earth one spoon research work is nothing but a a rab avatar of the same philosophy that i dont care if i use anybody elses food i would once again emphasized and no amount of emphasis but good enough that all of us must be extremely careful in ensuring that intellectual property is respected and protect one of the reasons why we have embarked on this large scale effort on creating open educational resources is that all learners can freely utilised at they can do so perfectly legal now i come to the second part and the main part of my session which relates to the next two weeks of her online activities namely building and nurturing collaborative community all of us are very comfortable working alone when i work alone on a given task i see several advantages first of all i can do that work at any time and place that i choose i dont depend on others second i control the quality of that work so i dont have any meddling from others heard if there is a team of people then i have to live with the idiosyncrasies of those people in the tea and this is not only related to their different professional competencies but they were their work habits their behavior you know how difficult it is for multiple people to work together even personnel interaction would force a problem so these are some of the disadvantages because of which i would like to work alone however let us look at the advantages of any team working together a stable when i work alone the amount of time that i can spend is always limited approach there are only twenty four hours in a day if you stay three or four people work together each one can contribute substantial amounts and therefore the sum total of the efforts that a team can putin is always larger then the effort that any one person can in fact thats an oxymoron it is a mathematically proven fact that sum total of a number of peoples effort is always greater than the effort by one person but i might want to add greater than or equal to why we are all other members are sleeping member that is their only notional neighbors but they dont do any work then the contribution will be only same as my own choices to be understood in a show that the team actually count if in fact it contributes in such a meaningful fashion then as it is no many times two plus two does not become poor but it can become a team for four people were injured two people and their work in ordinated fashion in a collaborative way then the total work is quantitatively and qualitatively much better in what a single individual can this is not just to say that teamwork is important but i will also add one more thing if you look at problems that engineers and scientists of this century are expected to solve ugh all multi disciplinary problems as have already mentioned once these problems are both complex and multi disciplinary and therefore can not ever be solved by any single individual there are all to be solved by multiple teams working together at these teams must collaborate and coordinate their rep sadly we have not develop habits of working together efficient more sadly we have no important in our curriculum which will train our students to work together in teams in our i the system we invariably have group projects which are part of every subject that we teach are many subjects that we teach in other ing colleges the group projects take the form of only the final year project that the undergraduates will do and they usually have a team of three or four people working together unfortunately they have no guidance till then on how to work together effectively and efficiently they have no guidance then a howe plagiarism is bad and that they must do their own effort and document their own affairs as a result you see a large number of we take projects an emcee a projects richard ditto copies of some earlier cloth yes my dear friends is spreading like a cancer in this country and that can scratch to be removed there is no choice in front up and the flag holders of this campaign has to be teachers it will not have another month i suggested a few things although it is a digression but i will repeat that every college must make it obligatory that every project work done by either a single spoon or by the tea every research paper that is sent for publication by a faculty member or a team of faculty member must be displayed publicly on the website of the college if that is not done no degree should be awarded to students and no paper should be accepted for publication from teacher this single simple act will immediately prohibit people from falling temptation to copy from somewhere a dwi because public scrutiny transparency afterall that is what the government keep say that e governance be openness transparency and that bees correct things will happen wrong thing will now not sorry for this digression but is very very important that through our efforts we spread this message across the country and try to ensure s talking about the license a a behavior i will again urge all participating teachers that when they finish this epk or even otherwise they should raise this matter with their own issued authority they should raise this matter with the large in which they are in charge for the equipment hardware and software and if there is something which is illegal or something which is not properly respecting the ikea they must object and they must immediately stop using such there is no shortcut to that there is a harsh medicine that is required well as i said is spreading like cancer and cancer requires surgery it cannot be controlled by ordinary medicine and we are therefore all qualified surgeons now who i love to undertake that circuit where a scumbag too therefore the main topic where we want to establish and nurture collaborative community we start with a small team effort that is the reason why there is a team assignment to be completed by all participants after the online portion gets all of you her farm teams have gone through many of the teams many teams are properly done there between two to four people as was required they have identified the main domain in which they have an expertise now they will have to define a sub domain or the particular work which they wish to do together the nature of the work will be in the form of it we are generally that we are could take various shapes and forms for example somebody might some team might just decide to create a video lecture this set of video lectures explaining some cans some team might decide to design pieces with questions answers and explanations some other key might decide to give the description of a possible course project that can be done in one of the sub domains of their home as long as any work that is undertaken is done with an intention to provide an extremely good quality useful resource and usefulness will be decided at the people who will you please remember all the work that you submit as your team assignments will definitely be released as a part of the we are repository of these evthe and therefore that will be available and accessible to lots of teachers add millions of students and that is the reason why we must actually try and do this team assignment were very very carefully and serious i also noticed that in two remote centers have come across teams which consists of only one person i can see why that might have happened i mean i put myself into the shoes of that person and i realized what i just mentioned some time ago i more comfortable working alone if i have three more parc tab and if all three turn out to be sleep buttons then i will end up doing all the would agree if those people are not sleeping partners but they do not contribute meaningfully they do shoddy work their documentation contains errors then i spread my time in correcting those hair is as the reasons why im tempted to work alone but the point is we want to actually nurture the notion of working together in te when i work in team even if i considered myself to be the best person in that team i must realize that because i am the best perhaps have a greater responsibility to take others together with me and please remember that in a theme park even if i am the best i will always learn something from every other team yes every human being every participant in any team has some very plus points which are so unique that theyre not available in us we can learn from every other human who works with us something or the other it not it is not necessarily the technical competence alone but is behavioral niceties the way of functioning meticulousness so many characteristic which individually we may not possess all of them but a team will contribute to them in the teams were in a manner where they are not physically at the same place it puts some additional problems in the path of the timber for example consider there is a team of four people all four of them actually work in different city or will they work together that is the reason why in the afternoon session today and this you may want to note down the major part of the second session i understand that some users reputation simon a half appear assessment must be completed the time has been extended till today evening so you might want to use the part of the first afternoon session to complete the if you already completed you can directly go towards the app now cut during of the teamwork which i will now explain so let us come back to the cage where four people have to do a team were over a period of time but they are all not coming to a common place as colleagues in the a collage or a student hence if the same class even if they are i have to work individually from the pressing of their home or from the pressings of their office when the other members of the team may not be day this asynchronous nature of team work is increasingly going to be the common factor in almost all team even today you will find large team wish to software development for companies like tata consultancy services jointly with their partners such as boeing or microsoft or whatever youll find teams about two hundred people spread across twenty fireplaces add yet working like a military operation perfectly planned and coordinated and that is exactly what we need to first learn ourselves and then teach our students how to do that unfortunately the domain of management which deals with project management and which therefore has a complete set of systems on how to handle themes and team were whenever the thieves do a project that knowledge is not accessible to scientists and engineers because that is considered project management is considered a topic under management domain which is not in the syllabus of any engineering or science this is very sad but what i am trying to suggest is that if we have to perfect the teamwork that we will do it is mandatory that we learn from our brothers and sisters who practice management and at least the projects management component we should try to learn their best practices unfortunately this fdc cannot cover project management in its entirety but i would like to mention today a few things which all of us must learn few very basic thing and then practice those why we do the teamwork for the team assignment and later when we train our students to work in te so let me take matters in sequence there are five things which are going to mention that you may want to note down number one handling team communication how do you handle team communication the team communication can be handled either through face to face meetings or through emails there is no other mechanic if emails have to become the standard way of handling communication there are several things that need to be pre decided pre agreed by the team simple thing what should be the subject line of an email which is related to this but what are the email id is off the team many times we do not have this information easily available today of truth therefore the first task that you love to do is you will have to ensure that each member of the team has a copy of the complete contact details of all team preferably in a soft copy but also preferably as one single page hard copy web email id is had telephone numbers are written down all the team members that additionally since all themes at a particular remote center form a larger group although the individual teams in that group might be working on different problems but collectively they do form a coherent group in the sense that david affiliation to that remote said therefore this information must be available with the workshop coordinator of the remote site if you are not already done that please ensure note that this is done as the first task today in the afternoons whenever you exchange messages through email as i already mentioned you must standardize on what should be the line in the subject that will mention uga invariably when we read our email the first thing that we read is the subject and the subject is black are the subject is arbitrarily return that were not able to correlate what will be the end the email itself should be short and brief but succint and carefully written people think that they can afford to write bad english in an email only in a document which is to be formally submitted which is the properly word process they should take care of correcting all grammar and spelling mistake that is not correct even in email communication has to be as perfect as a document that will prepare mistakes can happen even i make mistakes but i will tell you a habit which have developed even if i write a slightly longish email having two paragraphs i never press the set button unless i have read it at least once completely and carefully and try to see whether there is any spelling mistakes in grammar then only i praise thats it but this is a discipline that we must himself and this discipline must be visible amongst all the team members who collectively interact through emails the second important thing about the communication is that you often have to exchange documents images video clips or other material that you are preparing as a component for your team is and what should be the format of such files at what should be the names of such file naming conventions in fives are extremely important because otherwise they could be a large number of files with very same or similar names causing confusion as to what does that file and you have to evolve a file naming convention amongst the team members so that wherever you attach fights everybody will know from the neighbor the file itself roughly what that file should be the format in which the data in that file should be stored should also be pre decide for example if it is to be an editable text file such that i prepare that file and a colleague of mine on the theme might have to modify that file type then the file has to be editable to fit the text file you may decide whether it should be a dot creates the file it should be a dot odity five like open document format for a open source rub what process or it should be a dot doc file for microsoft word a word processor to be you my request is make sure that if you decide that all editable text files will be taught dock or not dockets fights then make sure that all the members of the team have access to legal copies of microsoft office if you do not have access to legal copies of microsoft office you pet park use that software to edit those fine period it is blasphemy it is a criminal offense and we will not commit crime anymore in the worst case use ordinary text files it is perfectly far better still use open source what proves of course if you are more comfortable with microsoft or any other proprietary package burdened by the lies and then use that much but shes nowhere tofu but a team effort suppose there were four member the of us have let say software license for the best package for photo editing because we might be working on creating some engineering drawings or photos but the fourth person does not have the life the other four percent said boss if you do this i will not be able to contribute anything i can use only this open source app or the benefit of that one person all the remaining three must agree to use that software which is commonly used i am elaborating but is very important that initially itself the team decides what kind of pizza software will be used to prepare that project and what kind of communication standards will be a stab the second thing is about the discipline of the activity itself the activity itself thus they said could be a project of your choice that tab you may decide to do generally resulting in an ohio and as i already mentioned think about the possibilities that three or four of you are two of you whatever be the teams i can do together but let us be very clear about this the team effort is expected to be equivalent of what should i say two days of full time work that is what is the team effort one day a full time work is eight hours on end up two days a full time work sixteen hours let me see each individual member must put it on is to god sixteen hours of work since the coordination in team takes away some time this will be plus or minus some plans but not mind that this effort obviously cannot be put in a single day it has all of us have to do so many other things i would submit that the best way of going about it i to divide the work such that you can spend two hours every day he advantage will be that you will have to attend to emails which come from your colleagues tell me some consolidation and coordination of the work that will have to be done and therefore spread the work is a time frame which is suitable for all of the time limit that has been announced for submitting the team assignment is two weeks after the conclusion of the tidbits that is whenever the ten week online activity of the evthe ends you have to complete and submit the team assignment four weeks is the time because four days of work not two days of work but four days of work has to be done but the team to the total amount eifert is out thirty to hours of effort on each individual and thats a huge amount now you may not take four weeks you may compress it to two weeks were complicit to three week you may even compressing to one week if all the team members are sitting together and working at the same but suffice it to say that the material that you produce at the requires that you submit along with it i will explain what records will have to submit must demonstrate very clearly that every member of the team has put in the required amount rtfa please note that the wire that you produce not only should be usable not only should be high quality but it should be almost like a work of art that you should be proud of yes hundreds and thousands of people are going to look at tha your names are going to be written on that we are your names are going to remember and therefore it should be a matter of great pride that you perform that act of all very very careful and delicate coming back to the scheduling of the activity that i mentioned such a team has to be coordinated at there has to be one team leader multiple people cannot take decisions on the same time and therefore every team has to have a leader normally as we shall see over the next two weeks in larger teams of volunteers which emerged to support typically open source software development or any other activity leadership emerges here we do not have time for leadership to emerge i understand that the team formation which has been provided by all the participants already has the name of a person as the team leader i am i right in assuming that the teams already have a team leader i would like to advise the team leader as follow your nudge leader because you are extraordinarily better than all other you are one amongst the equals europe they are all your peers leading a peer group is far more difficult then leading a hierarchical group of juniors since they are all equal the leader has to demonstrate the ability to take everybody together one has to grow hot and blue old somebody will served on a deadline and everybody else will suffer now the leader is a choice of shouting through a harsh email or as a choice of picking up the phone and speaking sweetly will you please do this quickly because everybody is waiting for it a multiple ways of handling this at this should teach us a whole lot about human intellect but at the end of the day once a person is named as team leader a good or bad whatever the team does the team leader gets maximum credit of the teams work and team leader also gets the maximum debit of the team the team does not perform the whole team will lose out on the credibility but the leader will lose outmost what should the leader do at this is the next task that the leader should do jointly with the team members today itself namely the side or the exact schedule so define that with the ten weeks of face to face interaction finishes or even earlier if they so wish what are the kind of activities that individuals of the group will undertake what will be that the frequency with which emails will have to be sent by the members what will be the frequency of consolidation to the material we will do what review when when final documentation of that we are will be commencing who will do that review and correction and when that final documentation along with the wwe is fully ready to sub is not trivial activities my dear friends one suggestion is if the frequency of at least two emails per week if not three emails which are mandatory to be said by every participant independent of whether any substantial work has been that during that period are only very little amount of work is we will suggest a comprehensive mechanism whereby will be able to track all the emails because the email exchanges you have to send a copy to a specific address which will outline so that all the emails that we exchange within the teams are available and accessible for the backend team to look at where that will display the effort at the frequency at which such a puppy but what is more important is the coordination of these efforts has to be done at the level of debt is paid time today afternoon in discussing the modalities of how you will complete this particular task in the remaining two weeks in the first week i will be discussing samba this modality so discuss these modalities and try to finalize two your at your head what you would like to do and how you would like to do it as part of the team were for the assignment that you choose however both freezer please wait for the discussion that will happen over the next week in the online portion of the next week you will have inputs precisely helping you to decide on these matters or how people take this issue if you think some of the inputs some of the suggestions make sense you may try to incorporate those add modify the this year that you have taken about the communication about the file formats about the methodology about the scheduling etc the fourth important thing that you will have to do is maintain a tracking record basically id like the history of your activity we are very bad at writing our history as have already mentioned earlier but it is important that we learn to write the history of the activities that we do ordinarily such history is written by professionals by accumulating daily time sheets i think had mentioned it once that when our students go and take up a job they dont have to just sign the attendance but every day there to fill up a time sheet saying what they have done in the day and how much time they spend on each activity i might have spent two hours in reading something one hour in drafting something one hour in writing an old report two hours is reviewing some design other work i am required to treat it does not take more than two or three minutes but unless i put in the time shit at the end of the day i dont get paid for that day that is the standard way in which industry works we dont work in that way in our schools dont work in that but when it comes to doing a project it is important that we learn to maintain the project diary and the account of the time that we spend and the nature of activity for which we spent that time i might spend some time in writing emails or reading emails from my partner but much of the time i vowed to spend on doing a part of the activity which has been assigned to me jointly by the team and that part i will be doing at my own chosen tie generally i may not keep any reco believe me if we dont keep any records six months later if i were to ask you how much time did you spend on the project you will generally say about thirty hours twenty flavors forty hours alright how much of that time did you spend in writing something i dont remember how much of that time you spend in thinking about an idea i dont remember our memory is short we dont remember this the only way we can remember is if we whenever we carry out an activity we actually write it down now we dont have the habit of writing diary even if we were to write our write diaries they would generally contain the personal observations of what happened in a day on every day were not talking of that were talking about professional guy in the next week i will be giving you a format a suggested format on which such diaries are maintained we have been using these formats are the subject was that our students do in some of our courses for example when our stood while team project is has won one which is an introductory programming the words then apart from the project code that they have written apart from the project documentation that they return they have to submit a composite dairy in individual diary has to be maintained by every a person of the team and that dairy must say it it is not a daily diary but whenever they do a project activity there to write the date start time end time and a brief one line description of what activity that did this diary is maintained by every individual it is consolidated by the team leader of the team at the end where you have names of all individual participants you do not have the start time end time but you have a major activity component such as discussion review documentation programming or whatever other work thinking reporting consolidation whatever world at what you have to do is each individual person calculate the total time aspect for example in review i might start review upon submission made by a colleague ched today i might spend fifteen region the day after tomorrow i might review for half an hour somebody elses day three days later i might use somebody elses things if i am supposed to be the review of the tea now this these entries will be making in my diary but at the end of the project i must submit my team leader the total type that has paid for review the total time has paid for writing emails the total time as paint faux leather say writing a documentation these timings believe me will not otherwise be available if we dont write them down the moment we finished that diaries cannot be constructed at the end of the project from memory human memories and believe me im telling you this from experienced personnel experience unless you jotted down the same day letters so dont sleep unless you omit the relevant entry it will not take more than thirty seconds or one minute and maintain a diary and write down what youve done in a day but ten minutes fifty minutes half an hour approximately youll be surprised that many of you would actually spend much more time in the team assignment then what you are expected to spend because they are unknown components of activities which will suddenly iml where it will take your car is worth while to document so let me recall number one you will set up standards for communication number two you will set up schedules are different activities and schedules for both the communication and who will do what when and will defi let us say our team will try to complete this not in four weeks but in two weeks itself but then i will have to ensure that all team members agree to do more work on this day this day these days the days on which emails must be exchanged must be very clearly noted down and agreed to by everyone the dates on which the team leader will communicate to all other members of the team must also be agreed upon and the team leader must ensure that such consolidation happens at the end of the team leader at the appointed time solder your doing is your fixing a schedule in short your planning and your planning in a very deliberate fashion so that you can work almost like a military operation well ive military operation so those to be without bothering out details because you know exactly what is expected at what the deadlines are supposed to be heard daily so please remember when we say twelve midnight it would be in two minutes past midnight weve always wanted to be very careful that is why you will notice that when we say the session will start at eleven fifteen if it does not star we apologetically inform everyone that the session we start fifty bracelet at a ministry we have to learn the value of these deadlines in this context let me recall what my workshop team told me three days ago and repeated it yesterday youll remember that the deadline for submitting the feedback related to plagiarism was twenty second midnight a number of people have requested either by phone or by email saying please extend this deadline now this deadline is not extendable was it was a hard deadline and has announced that at it you know what will happen as a result they are perhaps wow hundred people i do not know from the sample i can estimate they could be a hundred people who for some reason did not fill up that survey and therefore are positively deprive of getting a certificate of completing this evthe although they have done all the work diligently as they will be completing even the team a sign i apologise to such people in advance because they cannot be considered for certification however if they feel that they will benefit from continuing to work and learn they must help but that is what art did like me add deadline means every person in the team must meet that deadline of the activity not even one minute late and let us learn all of these ourselves let us practice all of these ourselves so that when we train our students then we train them properly i do not know but i can tell you the difference between the college where i studied the essjay site is in the er one of the good colleges like all your colleges and the itee bombastic in my college there used to be deadlines announced by the teachers saying this assignment is due this time a few people go to him oh so holy tea oh holy men nachi guy though wishing a crumb nokia there though the insa extension with the teacher perhaps also has enjoyed the wholly in the same manner so it is okay to mold that means we announce deadlines then we announces extension to those deadlines when we announce further extension to those deadlines and this becomes a matter of practice to the extent that our students assume terry deadline will be extinct and because they do so also issue the deadlines will be a kid the difference between the developing world and developed world that the developer does not believe in extension of deadline a deadline is a hard deadline we are now becoming a developer you are the frontline representatives of the developer being trained in a manner of using the most modern technology for effective education you have to respond to that call saying that you will set an honor hard deadline and if you miss the deadline sorry you missed something is not done touch so that is why the deadlines that you set for the timber have to be hard deadline and that we honor i will tell you a trick by which you can maintain these hard deadlines and their sanctity jabba the hutt deadline is tomorrow evening and the base plate is to complete that were by tonight let us by tomorrow morning its a deadline does not been that way to wait till the end to complete that what can be done earlier it is only a human psychology said rabbi timing jargon that time and therefore we can be d this scheduling that you will to ease the draft scheduling for your project try to perfect as much as is possible today afternoon if it is possible for you i would like you to have two sessions of course the first priority is to complete the assessment work of up to set up some its a sabotage portion but i guess many of you would have completed it and that may not take much time i would suggest that at each remote center they should be individual team meetings first where individual members of the team will discuss and decide i would suggest take about half an hour to take that decision of an hour to fourty five minutes spent ten minutes in writing down whatever you decide this would agree of course has to be done by the team leader who as i said will get more credit for the overall project anyway but all other people can assess once you have decided on this spend some time on more time on deciding on what particular activity you would like to undertake as that he will sign and of course the other thing the damage towards the end i would request all such teams to come together and have a collective meeting their individual team leaders or any member try to suggest that they have formulated such and such came for while nomenclature for scheduling for him a standardization etcetera etcetera and share their thoughts with everyone who knows some of the teams might have come up with something which is more useful as a process in some other tips try to evolve the best process that you think and discuss their join this meeting will not require more than forty minutes thirty fight thirty to forty minutes is the tie which should be coordinated by the workshop coordinator ed not every member of the community because every remote center has anywhere between a twenty to fifty people of course a remote center which has fifty or more people they might break themselves into two groups to conduct the discussion because the idea is not that everybody speaks there but the idea is you know exactly what carmen a inputs that we need to share at those inputs have to be given by a few representative there could be some discussion on whether this approach is better that approach is better a major part of the timber is running such meetings a feast shall tell you two things about running meetings which they developed practices first of all no meeting ever take place without a written agenda second for each agenda item there is an estimated time which is written against that agenda item seven minutes for this ten minutes for their fifteen minutes for this three minutes for this third there is a time keeper who is neither the president of that meeting namely the workshop vernita here nor individual team leaders any one person who is chosen and appointed and that person does nothing but start shouting the moment those seven minutes are over for particular so he will politely mention that for this particular agenda item where quick seven minutes already two people have spoken for three minutes each now word concluded right down the confusion in one minute chart and at the end the seventh minute the timekeeper must force the chairman of the committee or the meeting to go to the next item we are not used to functioning like it is very very important that we learn it and i suggest that you use the opportunity of this face to face interaction remember i mentioned this earlier also yes there was a feeling in the minds of many participants that face to face interaction means that is the time when we interact with the faculty a deity but of course that is one bar that you do but this the other important part perhaps more important parties you interact with each other and that opportunity you will not get once you go back to your respective places colleges or homes please try to inculcate this learning how to conduct a meeting efficient irresponsibility should be taken by the workshop vernita any one person can act as a timekeeper the person of course participates in the meeting and deliberations but the primary at least that person is on the watch this time is gone now nothing more will so at the very beginning in this video i suggest that the workshop coordinator should announce that we shall discuss these three items today and for each item we have these ten minutes ten minutes ten minutes or whatever and then will have a concluding discussion for seven minutes and final conclusions will be announced in the last one this is the way in which you can conduct a proper meeting of course george all faculty members you must be participating in your faculty meetings of the institute or the departmental faculty meetings but i can suspect that neither the institute faculty meeting nor the departmental faculty meeting is conducted with explicit attention to timespan for every individual item we have in your faculty meeting he amount of time listed against each agenda item for which the deliberations will take place most affected the meeting do not refresh time those who have such time written though i will as the next question are you a hundred percent sure that in every faculty meeting the time is adhered too scrupulously and not a single minute is spent more than that it does not happen the reason is simple indians are very expensive people expunge you not expect that be is for them time is unlimited it rose from minor simply need to plus impeded the while time actually is unlimited the time available to us is limited overall it is the on an average hundred years out of which we spend so much time in doing the evthe which is ten weeks online plus another four weeks and when we come face to face the time is still more limited and therefore every second every minute of that time must be meaningfully utila please remember when that thing a meeting is actually an extremely important exercise as part of the timber here is a large team coming together for deliberating on something important and yet not being critical of the use of time for which the meeting is taking so please utilize this critical time learn something from these teamwork also called conducting a meeting efficient i will conclude by saying that the team assignment that you will do is an extremely important component of the entire evthe in the earlier part youbeen learning from experts different things practicing those two assignments and pieces and so on but in this park watch you do is entirely your own work a small team of people two to four people will be doing that work i will say this again there will be additional description by the way of what your to submit your submit tags for example did i mention tags that are to be submitted along with the we are that you give these are the tag which are words or phrases which yet be used as a parameter for searching so if i say thermodynamics for example then if thermodynamics a tag on any of the wee hours when i search thermodynamic all twenty two years pertaining to thermodynamic sure okay i will explain about tagging in the next weeks the activities but you will have to create such tax twig you submit data and creating tax has to happen while you are creating the material itself de historical capture of activities automatically happens on books platform all the activities that you been doing on haiti bombay exe for example are wrong call activity logs are there who saw which video when is law who attempted which pays well is long and will now be doing a downloading of all those event log that gigabytes of long and will be writing programs to automatically analyze them to learn about the statistical behavior of the parties however what is not long is the individual diaries for example how long i spend in thinking about a topic cannot be captured online where we set an email that can be captured when email was said by whom what was the subject of that email is know what was the attachment to that email is no and that is how once you start creating digital records it will be easier for you to ensure that your diaries are properly written girls all the timings at should be kept but please note that digital capture will only be capture of an event when it occurs that capture or that event log can never tell me the total time that an individual a spell on an activity and that is why while such capture is important writing your diaries is equally in this week you will get progressively worse will get some material describing how the a collaborative work is done you will have to look at some websites to which suggests how groups can collaborate but oh its the middle of this we are perhaps or a thursday i will upload an additional a pdb file which will give you our thinking of what should be the diary entries that individuals should rise and their diary entries that the consolidated diary should be submitted by the team leader you may take that as an input which is the format in which you will have to submit but that will come only on thursday meanwhile please remember every one of ways to record any activity that you do now after today evening which goes towards the team effort even if you spent that needs some time in thinking about an idea and jotting down a few things and then send an email you must have a record when you spend that time and what activity would as i said i am looking forward to having all these two thousand five hundred people turning out to be expert collaborators with me in our future efforts to treat larger number of people not all of them will be our teaching associates in future but i stand by my commitment that we will be identifying two hundred participants who will be honored with a recognition of the sap award of excellence i think there is a small non trivial amount of rupees five thousand that is the sap award that will be giving it is not for the award that i am delighted to see things happening this is the first step deepy wed my workshop team an all teachers are reporting that the activity levels are immensely high one of the reasons could be that this the first time because we have the iati bombay ics platform where online quizzes are being conducted and submissions are being done with perus i must mention a curious happening where many people in their interaction have said that this peer assessment is a bunk up thing that there are fears were not spending time in assessing properly i recall observing men russell london was conducting a session a angry lady saying that a tour the appears gaver sixteen out of twenty and seventeen out of twenty but one person gave zero and she cannot understand how anybody game his zero marks his something youre right even to our student if something irrelevant is ether they also argue half marker one month how can somebody gives you what it means is that that particular a gentleman or lady was completely careless giving zero zero zero some others might be careless in greek twenty twenty twinned one solution is that when you do such peer assessment you remove the outliers statistically outlier means that anything which is highest anything which is lowest is removed and you take the average of the remaining average is general is suppose to reflect it overall assessment which is more accurate however so the first time when we applied the peer assessment for this and therefore there are many broken hearts there i genuinely believe have done good work but because this peer assessment and that too because some fear doing something haphazardly not being careful is causing me problems well i sympathize with such people the worry that many participants have is that while they have struggled hard to give all the quizzes and assignments if they score less than fifty percent marks because of this idiotic fear giving me zero here and there then is that fair well i will mention two things here number one life is not fair after all are we fair to our students how many dives we have observed either us polling to that temptation of prickly correcting the answer books and returning them by giving arbitrary marks how many times we have known of the cases of our own colleagues who dont do serious work of examining do stools complain they dont even know what has happened they just get much from their universe i think it is important that we collectively rise up to the athlete more important the second observation if the participants are very
