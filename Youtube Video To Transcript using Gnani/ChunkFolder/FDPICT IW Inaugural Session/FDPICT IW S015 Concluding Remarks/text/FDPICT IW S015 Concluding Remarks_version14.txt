what can be done earlier it is only a human psychology said rabbi timing jargon that time and therefore we can be d this scheduling that you will to ease the draft scheduling for your project try to perfect as much as is possible today afternoon if it is possible for you i would like you to have two sessions of course the first priority is to complete the assessment work of up to set up some its a sabotage portion but i guess many of you would have completed it and that may not take much time i would suggest that at each remote center they should be individual team meetings first where individual members of the team will discuss and decide i would suggest take about half an hour to take that decision of an hour to fourty five minutes spent ten minutes in writing down whatever you decide this would agree of course has to be done by the team leader who as i said will get more credit for the overall project anyway but all other people can assess once you have decided on this spend some time on more time on deciding on what particular activity you would like to undertake as that he will sign and of course the other thing the damage towards the end i would request all such teams to come together and have a collective meeting their individual team leaders or any member try to suggest that they have formulated such and such came for while nomenclature for scheduling for him a standardization etcetera etcetera and share their thoughts with everyone who knows some of the teams might have come up with something which is more useful as a process in some other tips try to evolve the best process that you think and discuss their join this meeting will not require more than forty minutes thirty fight thirty to forty minutes is the tie which should be coordinated by the workshop coordinator ed not every member of the community because every remote center has anywhere between a twenty to fifty people of course a remote center which has fifty or more people they might break themselves into two groups to conduct the discussion because the idea is not that everybody speaks there but the idea is you know exactly what carmen a inputs that we need to share at those inputs have to be given by a few representative there could be some discussion on whether this approach is better that approach is better a major part of the timber is running such meetings a feast shall tell you two things about running meetings which they developed practices first of all no meeting ever take place without a written agenda second for each agenda item there is an estimated time which is written against that agenda item seven minutes for this ten minutes for their fifteen minutes for this three minutes for this third there is a time keeper who is neither the president of that meeting namely the workshop vernita here nor individual team leaders any one person who is chosen and appointed and that person does nothing but start shouting the moment those seven minutes are over for particular so he will politely mention that for this particular agenda item where quick seven minutes already two people have spoken for three minutes each now word concluded right down the confusion in one minute chart and at the end the seventh minute
