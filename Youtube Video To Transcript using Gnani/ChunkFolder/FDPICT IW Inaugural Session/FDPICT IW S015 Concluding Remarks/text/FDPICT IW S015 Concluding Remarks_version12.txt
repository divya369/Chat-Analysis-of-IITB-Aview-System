the words then apart from the project code that they have written apart from the project documentation that they return they have to submit a composite dairy in individual diary has to be maintained by every a person of the team and that dairy must say it it is not a daily diary but whenever they do a project activity there to write the date start time end time and a brief one line description of what activity that did this diary is maintained by every individual it is consolidated by the team leader of the team at the end where you have names of all individual participants you do not have the start time end time but you have a major activity component such as discussion review documentation programming or whatever other work thinking reporting consolidation whatever world at what you have to do is each individual person calculate the total time aspect for example in review i might start review upon submission made by a colleague ched today i might spend fifteen region the day after tomorrow i might review for half an hour somebody elses day three days later i might use somebody elses things if i am supposed to be the review of the tea now this these entries will be making in my diary but at the end of the project i must submit my team leader the total type that has paid for review the total time has paid for writing emails the total time as paint faux leather say writing a documentation these timings believe me will not otherwise be available if we dont write them down the moment we finished that diaries cannot be constructed at the end of the project from memory human memories and believe me im telling you this from experienced personnel experience unless you jotted down the same day letters so dont sleep unless you omit the relevant entry it will not take more than thirty seconds or one minute and maintain a diary and write down what youve done in a day but ten minutes fifty minutes half an hour approximately youll be surprised that many of you would actually spend much more time in the team assignment then what you are expected to spend because they are unknown components of activities which will suddenly iml where it will take your car is worth while to document so let me recall number one you will set up standards for communication number two you will set up schedules are different activities and schedules for both the communication and who will do what when and will defi let us say our team will try to complete this not in four weeks but in two weeks itself but then i will have to ensure that all team members agree to do more work on this day this day these days the days on which emails must be exchanged must be very clearly noted down and agreed to by everyone the dates on which the team leader will communicate to all other members of the team must also be agreed upon and the team leader must ensure that such consolidation happens at the end of the team leader at the appointed time solder your doing is your fixing a schedule in short your planning and your planning in a very deliberate fashion so that you can work almost like a military operation well ive military operation so those to be without bothering out details because you know exactly what is expected at what the deadlines are supposed to be heard daily so please remember when we say twelve midnight it would be in two minutes past midnight
