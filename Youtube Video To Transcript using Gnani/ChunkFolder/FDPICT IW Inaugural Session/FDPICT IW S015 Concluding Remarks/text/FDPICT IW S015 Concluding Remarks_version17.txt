i am looking forward to having all these two thousand five hundred people turning out to be expert collaborators with me in our future efforts to treat larger number of people not all of them will be our teaching associates in future but i stand by my commitment that we will be identifying two hundred participants who will be honored with a recognition of the sap award of excellence i think there is a small non trivial amount of rupees five thousand that is the sap award that will be giving it is not for the award that i am delighted to see things happening this is the first step deepy wed my workshop team an all teachers are reporting that the activity levels are immensely high one of the reasons could be that this the first time because we have the iati bombay ics platform where online quizzes are being conducted and submissions are being done with perus i must mention a curious happening where many people in their interaction have said that this peer assessment is a bunk up thing that there are fears were not spending time in assessing properly i recall observing men russell london was conducting a session a angry lady saying that a tour the appears gaver sixteen out of twenty and seventeen out of twenty but one person gave zero and she cannot understand how anybody game his zero marks his something youre right even to our student if something irrelevant is ether they also argue half marker one month how can somebody gives you what it means is that that particular a gentleman or lady was completely careless giving zero zero zero some others might be careless in greek twenty twenty twinned one solution is that when you do such peer assessment you remove the outliers statistically outlier means that anything which is highest anything which is lowest is removed and you take the average of the remaining average is general is suppose to reflect it overall assessment which is more accurate however so the first time when we applied the peer assessment for this and therefore there are many broken hearts there i genuinely believe have done good work but because this peer assessment and that too because some fear doing something haphazardly not being careful is causing me problems well i sympathize with such people the worry that many participants have is that while they have struggled hard to give all the quizzes and assignments if they score less than fifty percent marks because of this idiotic fear giving me zero here and there then is that fair well i will mention two things here number one life is not fair after all are we fair to our students how many dives we have observed either us polling to that temptation of prickly correcting the answer books and returning them by giving arbitrary marks how many times we have known of the cases of our own colleagues who dont do serious work of examining do stools complain they dont even know what has happened they just get much from their universe i think it is important that we collectively rise up to the athlete more important the second observation if the participants are very
