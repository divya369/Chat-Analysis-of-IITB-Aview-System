and therefore every team has to have a leader normally as we shall see over the next two weeks in larger teams of volunteers which emerged to support typically open source software development or any other activity leadership emerges here we do not have time for leadership to emerge i understand that the team formation which has been provided by all the participants already has the name of a person as the team leader i am i right in assuming that the teams already have a team leader i would like to advise the team leader as follow your nudge leader because you are extraordinarily better than all other you are one amongst the equals europe they are all your peers leading a peer group is far more difficult then leading a hierarchical group of juniors since they are all equal the leader has to demonstrate the ability to take everybody together one has to grow hot and blue old somebody will served on a deadline and everybody else will suffer now the leader is a choice of shouting through a harsh email or as a choice of picking up the phone and speaking sweetly will you please do this quickly because everybody is waiting for it a multiple ways of handling this at this should teach us a whole lot about human intellect but at the end of the day once a person is named as team leader a good or bad whatever the team does the team leader gets maximum credit of the teams work and team leader also gets the maximum debit of the team the team does not perform the whole team will lose out on the credibility but the leader will lose outmost what should the leader do at this is the next task that the leader should do jointly with the team members today itself namely the side or the exact schedule so define that with the ten weeks of face to face interaction finishes or even earlier if they so wish what are the kind of activities that individuals of the group will undertake what will be that the frequency with which emails will have to be sent by the members what will be the frequency of consolidation to the material we will do what review when when final documentation of that we are will be commencing who will do that review and correction and when that final documentation along with the wwe is fully ready to sub is not trivial activities my dear friends one suggestion is if the frequency of at least two emails per week if not three emails which are mandatory to be said by every participant independent of whether any substantial work has been that during that period are only very little amount of work is we will suggest a comprehensive mechanism whereby will be able to track all the emails because the email exchanges you have to send a copy to a specific address which will outline so that all the emails that we exchange within the teams are available and accessible for the backend team to look at where that will display the effort at the frequency at which such a puppy but what is more important is the coordination of these efforts has to be done at the level of debt is paid time today afternoon in discussing the modalities of how you will complete this particular task in the remaining two weeks in the first week i will be discussing samba
