this modality so discuss these modalities and try to finalize two your at your head what you would like to do and how you would like to do it as part of the team were for the assignment that you choose however both freezer please wait for the discussion that will happen over the next week in the online portion of the next week you will have inputs precisely helping you to decide on these matters or how people take this issue if you think some of the inputs some of the suggestions make sense you may try to incorporate those add modify the this year that you have taken about the communication about the file formats about the methodology about the scheduling etc the fourth important thing that you will have to do is maintain a tracking record basically id like the history of your activity we are very bad at writing our history as have already mentioned earlier but it is important that we learn to write the history of the activities that we do ordinarily such history is written by professionals by accumulating daily time sheets i think had mentioned it once that when our students go and take up a job they dont have to just sign the attendance but every day there to fill up a time sheet saying what they have done in the day and how much time they spend on each activity i might have spent two hours in reading something one hour in drafting something one hour in writing an old report two hours is reviewing some design other work i am required to treat it does not take more than two or three minutes but unless i put in the time shit at the end of the day i dont get paid for that day that is the standard way in which industry works we dont work in that way in our schools dont work in that but when it comes to doing a project it is important that we learn to maintain the project diary and the account of the time that we spend and the nature of activity for which we spent that time i might spend some time in writing emails or reading emails from my partner but much of the time i vowed to spend on doing a part of the activity which has been assigned to me jointly by the team and that part i will be doing at my own chosen tie generally i may not keep any reco believe me if we dont keep any records six months later if i were to ask you how much time did you spend on the project you will generally say about thirty hours twenty flavors forty hours alright how much of that time did you spend in writing something i dont remember how much of that time you spend in thinking about an idea i dont remember our memory is short we dont remember this the only way we can remember is if we whenever we carry out an activity we actually write it down now we dont have the habit of writing diary even if we were to write our write diaries they would generally contain the personal observations of what happened in a day on every day were not talking of that were talking about professional guy in the next week i will be giving you a format a suggested format on which such diaries are maintained we have been using these formats are the subject was that our students do in some of our courses for example when our stood while team project is has won one which is an introductory programming
