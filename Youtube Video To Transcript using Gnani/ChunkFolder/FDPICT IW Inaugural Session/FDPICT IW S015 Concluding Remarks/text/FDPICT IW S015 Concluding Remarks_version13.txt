weve always wanted to be very careful that is why you will notice that when we say the session will start at eleven fifteen if it does not star we apologetically inform everyone that the session we start fifty bracelet at a ministry we have to learn the value of these deadlines in this context let me recall what my workshop team told me three days ago and repeated it yesterday youll remember that the deadline for submitting the feedback related to plagiarism was twenty second midnight a number of people have requested either by phone or by email saying please extend this deadline now this deadline is not extendable was it was a hard deadline and has announced that at it you know what will happen as a result they are perhaps wow hundred people i do not know from the sample i can estimate they could be a hundred people who for some reason did not fill up that survey and therefore are positively deprive of getting a certificate of completing this evthe although they have done all the work diligently as they will be completing even the team a sign i apologise to such people in advance because they cannot be considered for certification however if they feel that they will benefit from continuing to work and learn they must help but that is what art did like me add deadline means every person in the team must meet that deadline of the activity not even one minute late and let us learn all of these ourselves let us practice all of these ourselves so that when we train our students then we train them properly i do not know but i can tell you the difference between the college where i studied the essjay site is in the er one of the good colleges like all your colleges and the itee bombastic in my college there used to be deadlines announced by the teachers saying this assignment is due this time a few people go to him oh so holy tea oh holy men nachi guy though wishing a crumb nokia there though the insa extension with the teacher perhaps also has enjoyed the wholly in the same manner so it is okay to mold that means we announce deadlines then we announces extension to those deadlines when we announce further extension to those deadlines and this becomes a matter of practice to the extent that our students assume terry deadline will be extinct and because they do so also issue the deadlines will be a kid the difference between the developing world and developed world that the developer does not believe in extension of deadline a deadline is a hard deadline we are now becoming a developer you are the frontline representatives of the developer being trained in a manner of using the most modern technology for effective education you have to respond to that call saying that you will set an honor hard deadline and if you miss the deadline sorry you missed something is not done touch so that is why the deadlines that you set for the timber have to be hard deadline and that we honor i will tell you a trick by which you can maintain these hard deadlines and their sanctity jabba the hutt deadline is tomorrow evening and the base plate is to complete that were by tonight let us by tomorrow morning its a deadline does not been that way to wait till the end to complete that
