hence if the same class even if they are i have to work individually from the pressing of their home or from the pressings of their office when the other members of the team may not be day this asynchronous nature of team work is increasingly going to be the common factor in almost all team even today you will find large team wish to software development for companies like tata consultancy services jointly with their partners such as boeing or microsoft or whatever youll find teams about two hundred people spread across twenty fireplaces add yet working like a military operation perfectly planned and coordinated and that is exactly what we need to first learn ourselves and then teach our students how to do that unfortunately the domain of management which deals with project management and which therefore has a complete set of systems on how to handle themes and team were whenever the thieves do a project that knowledge is not accessible to scientists and engineers because that is considered project management is considered a topic under management domain which is not in the syllabus of any engineering or science this is very sad but what i am trying to suggest is that if we have to perfect the teamwork that we will do it is mandatory that we learn from our brothers and sisters who practice management and at least the projects management component we should try to learn their best practices unfortunately this fdc cannot cover project management in its entirety but i would like to mention today a few things which all of us must learn few very basic thing and then practice those why we do the teamwork for the team assignment and later when we train our students to work in te so let me take matters in sequence there are five things which are going to mention that you may want to note down number one handling team communication how do you handle team communication the team communication can be handled either through face to face meetings or through emails there is no other mechanic if emails have to become the standard way of handling communication there are several things that need to be pre decided pre agreed by the team simple thing what should be the subject line of an email which is related to this but what are the email id is off the team many times we do not have this information easily available today of truth therefore the first task that you love to do is you will have to ensure that each member of the team has a copy of the complete contact details of all team preferably in a soft copy but also preferably as one single page hard copy web email id is had telephone numbers are written down all the team members that additionally since all themes at a particular remote center form a larger group although the individual teams in that group might be working on different problems but collectively they do form a coherent group in the sense that david affiliation to that remote said therefore this information must be available with the workshop coordinator of the remote site if you are not already done that please ensure
