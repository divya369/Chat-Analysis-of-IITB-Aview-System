the software which permits us to use that software freely modified distributed and therefore i can legally use something which otherwise might require obtaining a license at the cost in the context of open source software i will mention some discussion which happened yesterday i was sitting with my colleague up in front of my colleague mister turner when he was talking about the use of spoken tutorials in teaching people different thing and then there was a question saying silo which is one of the open source software having the same functionality as the well known commercial product matlab many teachers say that our students are more comfortable with matlab we are not comfortable with style and his answer i think was that the matter of comfort comes out of the matter of exposure and the matter practice however if your people and you are comfortable using matlab absolutely no problem make sure that every copy of the matlab that is used by any student on any computer at home or in the lab and by the teacher is a licensed fuck now that is a hard job because many of our institutions are not careful about checking whether the software is actually licensed software or no reason the sense that if we do not respect intellectual property right of others the rest of the world will never respect our intellectual property that picky so in a nutshell you are of course welcome to use any piece of software that you feel is required to do the necessary war however ensure that the software that you use is legal tender if it is a commercial product ensure that you have a license which is properly paid for if you cant afford that license then you must use an open source free software instead i will tell you any stance where this happened not now but thirty years ago when one of the researchers in a company godrej competitors doing research in graphic then was attending a conference in germany and in that not concerns a trade show and in one of the stalls he was shown a particular utility which was extremely good he wanted to see something more eddie says yes i can show you that something more but that requires an additional piece of software i have it loaded on the machine but i dont have license to run the license is only on the machine which is in my lab which is a hundred miles away but if you are willing to spend time i will drive you there show you that and then i will bring you back it did that because he did not have the license to run that software on that page do we inculcate these values amongst our students we insist that no student shall ever use unlicensed software do we do it ourselves very carefully we unfortunately do and that is the national problems not blaming anyone in particular but this problem will have to be sore it is this habit of not respecting the law of the law he says that if there is a proper commercial software it must be paid for before i start using it tempts us to do many other things also copying somebody elses material and passing it on earth one spoon research work is nothing but a a rab avatar of the same philosophy that i dont care if i use anybody elses food i would once again emphasized and no amount of emphasis
