the timekeeper must force the chairman of the committee or the meeting to go to the next item we are not used to functioning like it is very very important that we learn it and i suggest that you use the opportunity of this face to face interaction remember i mentioned this earlier also yes there was a feeling in the minds of many participants that face to face interaction means that is the time when we interact with the faculty a deity but of course that is one bar that you do but this the other important part perhaps more important parties you interact with each other and that opportunity you will not get once you go back to your respective places colleges or homes please try to inculcate this learning how to conduct a meeting efficient irresponsibility should be taken by the workshop vernita any one person can act as a timekeeper the person of course participates in the meeting and deliberations but the primary at least that person is on the watch this time is gone now nothing more will so at the very beginning in this video i suggest that the workshop coordinator should announce that we shall discuss these three items today and for each item we have these ten minutes ten minutes ten minutes or whatever and then will have a concluding discussion for seven minutes and final conclusions will be announced in the last one this is the way in which you can conduct a proper meeting of course george all faculty members you must be participating in your faculty meetings of the institute or the departmental faculty meetings but i can suspect that neither the institute faculty meeting nor the departmental faculty meeting is conducted with explicit attention to timespan for every individual item we have in your faculty meeting he amount of time listed against each agenda item for which the deliberations will take place most affected the meeting do not refresh time those who have such time written though i will as the next question are you a hundred percent sure that in every faculty meeting the time is adhered too scrupulously and not a single minute is spent more than that it does not happen the reason is simple indians are very expensive people expunge you not expect that be is for them time is unlimited it rose from minor simply need to plus impeded the while time actually is unlimited the time available to us is limited overall it is the on an average hundred years out of which we spend so much time in doing the evthe which is ten weeks online plus another four weeks and when we come face to face the time is still more limited and therefore every second every minute of that time must be meaningfully utila please remember when that thing a meeting is actually an extremely important exercise as part of the timber here is a large team coming together for deliberating on something important and yet not being critical of the use of time for which the meeting is taking so please utilize this critical time learn something from these teamwork also called conducting a meeting efficient i will conclude by saying that the team assignment that you will do is an extremely important component of the entire evthe in the earlier part youbeen learning from experts different things practicing those two assignments and pieces and so on but in this park watch
