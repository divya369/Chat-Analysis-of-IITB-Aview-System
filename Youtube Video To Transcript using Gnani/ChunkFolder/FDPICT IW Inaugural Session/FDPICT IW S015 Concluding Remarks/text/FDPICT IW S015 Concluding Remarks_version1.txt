an added attraction theyve said that please do it pressure fatigue but we dont have any funds to give you these are the kind of challenges that not only the technical education faces but the whole country place and we have to answer these challenges by coming together and working on arrow so this is the culminating set a weeks for the worst ever historic every ppi which concentrates on this aspect sounds the learnings that we had from this every ppi is that instead of conducting a comprehensive four week equivalent every ppi which takes more than twelve weeks to complete because ten weeks of online activity has to be completed before we have decided that will break this evthe into two parts the first part will concentrate on foundations of high city where will cover all the common technologies and their knowledge in a shorter chamber of a hefty fee equivalent to two weeks we shall mostly be conducted on the second component which relates to the pedagogy of effective use of technology in education will be covered in another hefty ppi which is equivalent of two weeks of work which of course if you consider the online activity it will run for at least five to six weeks with some interaction ab we may not have remote said this is the only places for that interaction right now on the drawing board many of my colleagues are working out the modalities but we are clear about one thing if were to conduct these programs in future to cater to a very large number of professional colleagues tell iety bombay ritish rper alone cannot do this task we will need assistance and help from committed professional teachers were willing to give their time and effort for helping us and that is the reason why we have conceptualized the scheme of teaching associates and wear from these teaching associates will come well to begin with they will come from amongst the two thousand five hundred teachers were participating in the recipe i look forward to seeing more of the passionate people among you were willing to lead this effort with us so that the learning that we have is communicated to a much larger number of her colleagues all across the kitchen i would like to repeat that in this matter of the newly emerging pedagogy on effective handling of i city or greater quality of education is not something hobbies textbooks are available or standard mattresses available all of us are learners people unite the bombay have been more fortunate for having experimented with these things our last five years so perhaps we know a bit more now you know something as you go back to your colleges in practice some of these at least a few of you could become better experts then even as a tip up and together we hope to take this style and technique o greater perfection so that the entire indian education system higher education higher technical education penn suggested the first point i wanted to share with all of the second point is not very pleasant as i had observed a last time that we noticed a few cases of undesirable plagiarism where some of their colleagues were tempted to copy submissions of their friends and submit those submissions as their own and in everything we take these things very seriously a generally dont occur
