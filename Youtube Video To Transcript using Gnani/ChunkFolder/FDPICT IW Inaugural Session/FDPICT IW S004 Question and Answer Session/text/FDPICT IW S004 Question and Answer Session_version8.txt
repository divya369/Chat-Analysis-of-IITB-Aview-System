there are some recommendations which are what we are repeating over and over that make sure theyre short measure students can do it make sure they sequenced in a way and so are regarding of most western which was about prerequisites so its assumed in general that the teacher is aware of what prerequisites are required for a particular tips when you created because youre the one whos also are taught the previous classes and youre the ones who have assigned the out of class activities so you definitely have to be aware of prerequisites and you design the activity accordingly if you want to mention it to the students that also fine you can in fact tell them the week before saying will have an activity next week where you have to watch these videos are you have to make sure that these prerequisites are met if you like to do that thats also fine last month or during the so question answered no i see that not most participants have been asking about the participation of each and every student in inside the classroom how do we get term moreno convinced that everybodys part is pretty one of the view so what i got one up suggestions what i got from a previous abc conduct a five minute term kind of a survey or i can taste kind of thing in the last to the terms we us faculty would come to know if they have really hated it or not there that might work the system is your kind of evaluation tests are center one zero three nine what is the advantage of api the pojo com faculty had different way of hiking but a bivy giving em em informaiton for all the faculty in how we are a guilty member can implement it thing easily the mindset how you can kill the main thing to answer to that are the main aim of this atp as prose of water can process on hasa reiterated is these things have come to you so how effectively can you make use of it job of the best thing if there is some point of difference between your strategy or you are thinking and what the instructors or the course content designers just find out what the differences are adobe whatever is acceptable and ask questions in these forums and to the other comic a community members participants as to are these differences of ballet a point are these differences valid so you get inputs from multiple people not just faculty so as prose of attack said we are all equals in this particular journey so there arent any right answers to say that all faculty should do exactly like this but there are some guidelines broad guidelines given to you by each of these activities at an abstract sense all these are proven effective through research educational research so educational to suggest something that you should believe in because many people have done it scientifically and deb found evidence so the evidence is the data and the evidences are speaking to you so hence these guidelines for the others it are the implementation varies from context to context and for that you will have to take help from the community to see whether these differences are valid and if they are valid what to do so i think the community will be able to help you a lot and that is why the focus is on building a collaborative community that a wo hours were going to support each other in this particular journey and feel free to test it in your own class you gotta think of this is a toolbox of strife
