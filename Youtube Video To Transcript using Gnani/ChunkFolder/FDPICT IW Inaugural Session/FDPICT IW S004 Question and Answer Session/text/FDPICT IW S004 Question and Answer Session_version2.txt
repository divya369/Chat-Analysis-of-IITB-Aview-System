what the teacher does is splitted into smaller parts but not smaller parts as in do this first then do this but the thing phase is sum is the aspect air contains the part of the problem which every student can do easily and then by the time they come to the pair they can build on the thin face and maybe it requires two people to actually crack the problem that is given in the preface so you can always structure a very highly complex problem into the three phases so that students build on the previous work previous solutions built to reach the finals so you will see similar recommendations in the guidelines for how to do tips that have been posted in fact this question is something that you should be asking whenever you see any new strategy which topic a suitable for the strategy which topic is not suitable topics which may not be suitable or objectives which may not be suitable for tips are when you have very routine step by step procedures for things that need to be memorized then tips may not be suited to an add on to this or if you look at the tips activity constructor at the end of it they were given three broad examples oners ben url you have something like multiple solutions nader is a problem solving tasks a third is a general a barrier to explore beyond the concept so these are three main areas where peoples is found to be really useful this app from our own experience center one zero nine eight place my question is regarding lead it would appear then the domain may be carried out by digital faculty member but no re energy environment is the burning topic and engineers must have a glitch on that we generally when agarwal did they go for a multi disciplinary or interdisciplinary articles question definitely driven to help you create an awareness about the snow above about the environment and energy in the relevant today ratner domain knowledge can be use to produce a product which is environment friendly and energy efficient judicial add an additional dimension the guns learning and the level of debt is that and begun that valuation creative level that ones mind can we go for the interdisciplinary type of a if a special thanks your comment is very well taken suggestion here is that if there are some issues like energy or climate change for example or the water problem which actually requires multidisciplinary perspectives to be able to solve it would that make a good tip is question and i havent personally tried it myself but i think it definitely would you can in fact in the pairs are in the shares as you can focus on these multiple perspectives so for example in the shares what he can do is try to get different pairs each coming from a different angle to say talk about their solution or their concern and actually highlight this sir is multiple perspectives so others if your teaching any topic similar to the similar or which can encompass such a problem are such a problem definitely suited yeah one more caution to add on to others see some of these topics are very sensitive so youll have to ensure that the activity the think pair share activity is more looking at the academic side of it rather than becoming a chaotic debate a bit different sides taking different views so theres not any biases you have to specifically focus on the academic angle where you look at the multiple aspects of the problem or the solution if you focused to that it will be a much more constructive tips within your class having said this evening
