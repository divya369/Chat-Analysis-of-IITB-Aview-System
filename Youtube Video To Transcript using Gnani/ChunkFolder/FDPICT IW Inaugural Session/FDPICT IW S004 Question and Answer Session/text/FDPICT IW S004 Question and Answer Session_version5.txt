and so on so when it comes to group learning activities there are actually two broad categories one is where the groups are well structured for example if you have a project that has to be done for the entire semester either the instructor makes the groups forms the groups on some criterias sometimes students form groups but these are structured group activities where the same group a does the choir does the task for a certain amount of time and so on are there are other group activities which are called unstructured group activities and think pair share as well as one more a strategy called pure instruction with some of you may be familiar with come under this unstructured group activity what unstructured unstructured doesn mean chaotic here it just means that there is no specific rule for group formation so it can be something as simple as turn to your neighbor or turn back or three of you were sitting there why dont you start talking so what the instructor can do here is to decide the maximum and minimum within a group in think pair share pair face we actually say try to limited to two because we found that its actually a good number in the peer instruction or clicker technique the group size some people work with two some work with three four five occasionally ten but i would say three to four is a very common number so you dont have to work very hard to create groups but you can just tell encourage people to turn to the left to right front to back and start forming the groups the second useful question that came up in chat a related to this is what should the instructor do should intervene should keep quiet and it is too so can the guidelines here are not very rigid which means you can experiment and see what works ive seen some instructors who do no intervention in the pair face except try to get quiet students to speak to start talking and some instructors go up and down the class go round the class and look into the pairs notebook see what theyve done give a quick word here and there so if you want some individual attention you wont pay individual attention to some groups you can do it with all groups but to some whoops thats also possible so both are okay strategies there was a one more question on flipped classroom is a course curriculum designed for flipped classroom so firstly such a question has to be asked within the scope of a single discipline or single core single subject there is no worldwide universal curriculum for which was for all subjects and even within a particular course or subject to discipline a i dont think there is the age specific curriculum that has come out but if people have tried and experimented in done research their published research on what theyve done how theyve done and what the research results so that is something you can start reading and finally one goal of the safebuy ppi is that we create a community resource a set of community resources where if you want to come up with your own flipped classroom curriculum you can borrow resources from each other you can use videos that she has created and the assignment that is created put it together share that collected one with your other colleagues and so so thats about the curriculum aspect one more question that we gotten chat ursa what type of feedback should be given to students in the in class activity so this actually depends on the specific activity that is happening and the goal of such feedback should actually to be to help the song
