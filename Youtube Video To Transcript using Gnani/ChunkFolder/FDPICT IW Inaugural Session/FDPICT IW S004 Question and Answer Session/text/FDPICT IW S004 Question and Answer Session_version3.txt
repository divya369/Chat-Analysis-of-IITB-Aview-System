the ethical was writing this while but here it is use of domain knowledge problem yes thats the job center one zero one five my question is regarding flip your classroom or the flipped classroom conflict will work only when all the students we look forward to the video outside the classroom the students will not watch the video outside the classroom they will not participate in the tiny side activity inside classroom activity so what is a remedy to overcome this issue so that all the students with a porch outside here videos so this question had come up even in the morning but its really important enough that its worth talking about again and the question is about slip classroom how do we ensure that all students watch the videos because students dont watch the videos then their participation in the inclus phase will be limited and so on and so forth this is definitely a valid concern and what we can do as teachers at best is to try to encourage and we will go towards ensuring that most of our students actually watch the videos so some strategies that people have used and that have worked hard to have a short in class quiz may be at the beginning that are based on the videos so this is the stick that you can provide us the students know that there will be tested maybe one marker to marquis thatll cound find semester assessment of this is one thing that people have tried it also good revision should have a quiz like this its a good revision of the video material the other thing you can try which actually encourages students rather than discourages them is to actually make the in class activities interesting as well as worthwhile for them to engage in class activities where they feel that yeah this is useful for me if not in my exam than in my project or in the interview that hell be appearing for next year or in my placement and so on so make the in class activities very relevant for them this will also pull in more students to participate in class activities and if they find that not watching the videos not helping them then youre likely to find more people watched the following time we will not vote the video so should we ignore what to do in class right okay what options do you have one is are you you ignore them or i think its worthwhile pointing out that look if you did not watch the video and cum you will have a hard time to race class dont allow them to disrupt your class because thats really not fair to the people who have already watched the videos and its also not sure if you re explain the concept just because five people in the class have not watched the video thats also not really the purpose but i think again this is something you have to try and see what works in your classroom what is usually worked for us here is that we point out we saw that look if you havent done it we wont have hard time today and then show it illustrates that actually its not a good thing for them to do it you can also send reminders here because we are dealing with various quality oat mixture so persuaded she took pity on him five per cent of the period ahead we hope to engage them in the class because we cannot ignore bay because they are having their right to right of education because they are paying a cafe so flipped classroom this concept will be applicable for literary edibles groups but for the byu students how we can manage them and we cannot repeat
