you can put up all the resources that your using not just as part of a ft you can also add additional resources that you have utilized in the classroom so for a mentor a for a mentee to understand yes my mentor is a knowledgeable my mentor is has a wealth of experience this particular thing so this is what we call as a teaching portfolio or course portfolio so this portfolio will introduce you to actually arm to the mentees so it will show them you the approachability with the mentors are of course you could put up a basic a m in your free to put up whatever you wanted the webpage a contact communication how much easily accessible you are all these information you could a that could be made visible through your own individual course portfolio so that could work as a producer for starters that could be a good icebreaker so for example if i am a mentee adds a okay id bombay says i am alerting you to a mentor so why should i look at this mentor so here even as it will be easier for us to say look at the resources created by your mentor in your previous evty so look at the a screencast that theyve created look at the moodle courses that they have created in the last of all dont you think and if you have a evidences or other things that your shed for your own courses you can add the doubts we can also be can actually a show of your mentees that there is there is benefit in interacting with you and they are also going to get a lot of knowledge from this particular interaction so that when there is this tangibility then slowly the barrier is going to break as in that is the first step a in terms of attitude and belief we should ensure that the your raw profiles are in sync with what they are what we intend so the intention is that you can provide best support to the mentee for we are creation so why dont why dont you see this particular mentors a personal web page so they will also be interacting with you and of course youll be ah as soon as we allot your arm alot a mentor to a mentee wheel be formally introducing the mentor to the mentee via email so each of your mentee will get an email telling them that obey this person is your mentor he has done so and so work you can look at his profile in this particular web page so this is the nature of email that actually go so if you have a webpage that will be easier for us for your mentees also to actually look and get convinced that yes this person could be a good mentor for me ah okay last time mentees take debut interaction very casually few of them were unable to interact just because they are not prepared for that well in advance ah yes this was observed in few of the mantis cases are there was this problem of mentor mentee interaction not being very arm arm but a second arm symbiotic for both of them are one reason is that we had only scheduled slots so that is why we are keeping eve you completely out of this measurement interaction this time around are no other reasons but yeah a many times it so happens that the slots a ben we have to do interactions at scale
