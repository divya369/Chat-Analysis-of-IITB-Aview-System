the basic interaction rules are in any collaborative process will be well maintained and since you are all faculty members i completely trust you your judgment while you are interacting with your group members this is very specifically to ensure that there is lot more information transmission across different places see a one major problem that we have seen while doing many of these every piece is that there is very less of interaction between one a horsey and and other artsy there are lot of things that each colleagues see as individuals also am learning a lot of new things from many of the participating teachers so similarly there is this learning opportunity that is available for all of you while youre working with a members outside your raw physical proximity a there is lot more new things that you will learn they are so you have all interacted at least once a during the previous every piece either via discussion forum or through some other mechanisms while your doing a the ebu interactions over here but what we want to make us we want to explicitly make this connection more stronger so that we get a good community of instructors who can help us in scaling these faculty professional development effort and see it is a lifelong learning process for any teacher learning never stops and we need to be ready to move out of our comfort zones work with different individuals yasu over here there is a very specific tasks for which your working but yeah the boundaries are set for the task but there is lot more that you can do and no one is stopping you from interacting with people from euro nazi a lot can happen even so we are not saying that you should not interact with other group members we actually encourage people to interact across groups also so see a try to utilize the groups creation process to interact with more number of people interact with multiple groups so that you get lot more idea about how you can effectively do a mentoring online or using educational technology tools so why do so that the question can we prepare our own course material in moodle so this is regarding the ft design activity see the updated design activities very a targeted they are targeted modules that we have identified which is related to the eff dippy content so if you actually look at are the updated design process it is actually are you showing us that you have achieved the te pack for the content knowledge of how to use a particular technology how to use a particular pedagogy four are doing teaching learning off if the content so we are through this particular course we are also this particular activity we are trying to ensure that you have sufficient te pack to a new exhibit sufficient impact to provide information about the eff dippy content and do a effective teaching learning with it so that is what a this updated design activity is about all this has to be a small moodle course so you know that adam a every module is worth one week of far in the online space which is effectively participants had to interact for a six to eight hours with the content and with other people in the courts to six to eight hours worth
