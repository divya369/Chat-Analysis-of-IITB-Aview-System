okay this is an interesting question will you guide the mentor part by part relating with the mentee work or we would really love to do that a will find some mechanism to ensure that so that is why we are giving content in a mode berry oduce a modular fashion so it is not that there is content for entire week so we are giving it piece by piece so and if you actually look at the next piece so will be spiraling across various modules across the course of depth regrow so initially we gave you examples of how what a tea packers and so we give you definitions of aipac and other things i in the next will go deep into teh pack and will show you how tea package useful or how teabaggers are how the teabaggers there in my fd one zero and an ability to zero won derby learning by doing activities through which you will get more insights on what the packers all about a similarly then will talk of farm evaluation self evaluation again evaluation in a hefty piece then will talk of this lunar community how lender community model is actually a scene in a hefty piece and how do you so youll you will first give be given a surface view then you will go deep then you will come back again will have a surface view then a good deep south through this spiraling for module go through multiple contents at multiple death and then that you will be using you have your own practice also so that practice will also inform a guard to a that will be usefull for you to go in deeper into actual application of us all these knowledges so yeah so a hobby or trying that in a certain context or part by part guidance to the mentee are mentors yes we are thinking of doing that but will have to formalize so will have to see how the mentor mentee interactions evolving based on that only we can decide how to support the mentors and our mentors in the process yazoo also this is a question regarding are you from idea bombay team planning anything like allotting mentees from enter from the same institute are itll be very difficult to record them internet interaction if the mentor mentees are from the same institution ah yes are we will try as far as possible that the mentors a mentor mentees are from multiple institutions but under the same geographical area so this is one criteria that we are actually looking at a but she will have to see how much of this is actually possible we also have this larger thing that the diversity may not be sufficient to capture this mix and match so at our end we will try to a use of a will try to use a as far as possible the best grouping mechanism that is available with us so question is what will be the timing for interaction how will i trust be document timing as i said it is up to you documentation also asset would be screenshots it could be put in your kernel you could upload that as a goddess bead i mean video in youtube small videos chunks of videos in youtube etc course te pack only published paper is there no video
