or in groups or we will have certain logistics issues which needs to be a address phone and itll be very difficult if we say that all of you have to use if you then are in that case you will be limited or youll be limited with the white youll be limited with just a view whereas there are lot of technology features other than a view that you can also explore so we are not saying no to a view for this particular offering guessing that lets not use a view because abu is a virtual classroom software so the same rules that a classroom has that means there is a start time there is an end time or it cannot be it cannot be made flexible that okay and i need to enter the class today i need to enter the class tomorrow if this has to be done there are lot of logistical overheads at our end also the means are there needs to be continuous interaction between eighty bombay and the mentors and mentees which actually makes it impossible so we will spend two weeks just doing the logistics and not having worthwhile interactions okay that is why we are not using a view for the current measurement interaction okay last time while mentoring the ment is the main problem i faced was lack of their response a veteran using meals whatsapp chat for communication if most of them does not fail to respond in spite of continuous reminder that creates lots of problems even if the answer is no that should be communicated i personally suggest that make it mandatory for mentees to provide a record of interaction with the mentors as one of the required submission so that interest for betterment interaction would be from both sides are i completely accept the suggestion that there should be something tangible from the mentees also but for this pilot offering see one thing that ive said is mentoring is not equal to monitoring your providing them guidance and it is up to the mentees to decide how they are going to take up your suggestion now abhere said that in the grading criteria are your mentees performance is going to be a major criteria for ra evolution but over there also were given web given you flexibility as in if your mentee score more than fifty per cent then you are youll get the full credits for the mentees are performance only if they go down or off fifty percent that is the only cause of concern and am hoping that your guidance would be sufficient to ensure that they go beyond the fifty percent but even in this case since this is the pilot offering we have a set up mechanisms to ensure that if the mentee has not interacted well with the mentor then dad gets counted in that particular thing gets counted while we are doing that a mentees performance a scenario so we will ensure that that gets accounted for in the a in your own grading as well is there any provisions to valid we are of our mentees first by a so that we can give feedback to improve before the sign final submission so we have recommended that you provide your via submission so it is a recommendation from our site to the mentees that since your mentors have already done the weir activity last year it would be worthwhile that you give your a we are a we are for your mint a mentors to evaluate first so that in case of peer review issues we could take up your mentors evaluation so this particular directory
