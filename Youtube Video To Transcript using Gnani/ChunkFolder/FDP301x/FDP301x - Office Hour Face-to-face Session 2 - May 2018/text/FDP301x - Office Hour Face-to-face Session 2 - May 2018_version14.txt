there is a basic skeleton that we are giving you you can decide to use the skeleton as it is or add on to it a question is are you offering hefty three for the first time yes this is the first offering of eff dippy three but for the last previous suffering we had the mentor mentee interactions across the course a beer now formalizing that into a course so that you will also get a benefit of a learning something new along the mentor mentee interaction a textile engineering and technology see it comes under chemical and allied arm if they are more participants we will definitely consider textile as separate domains so please create life science domain a currently licenses come under basic science are because many times so but there is also bio sciences and allied domains if you feel that you come under the bio sciences or the biomedical engineering and its ally domains feel free to join the bio sciences domain otherwise you can now join the basic sciences group see all these domains will get evolved as more and more participants come in so always new domains will be created after each iteration of deeply okay so there are two important questions what is the effect in reality of deepak on teaching and learning how to implement ipad if you are not able to find required technology that is suitable to pedagogical content knowledge see if your not able to integrate a technology so answering the second question first if you are not able to integrate technology at least ensure that the pedagogic content knowledge there are so taipei comes into picture only when you are planning to integrate a technology so there is no question that if the technology is not found what happens the packers meant especially when technologies present a what is the effect in reality of deepak so what is the effective deepak see the more you understand each of these knowledges the better your practice and that is what is actually judge so for example today you understood how to do some particular activity lets a how to create a glossary in moodle and leather like one of the question that was asked a important terms if we put these up as glossary upfront so you know the pedagogy of doing it and for what content you will have to do the glossary so it actually is improving your own practice so the better you are with the each piece of deepak the better your practice would be an inn this is also in reality there are no ideal scenarios over here a bird i find the corre sergio webb depot preserve annex it is in the first section a introduction after introduction there is a survey you can now do this first i think things to do first i think that is what its titles
