so that all of you will create a small model codes are for one particular module a of this particular if dtype which contains the objectives have appropriate instructional strategies and you will have appropriate assessment a strategy is to evaluate the learning process of that module then the next major outcome that will have us at the end of life after we have identified you we upgraded you are and identified that a people who pass from this course we will have a community of learners who will help itee bombay in scaling and sustaining the afdb efforts so you you will be also we will recommend a we will be informing your institutions that you could be taken up as course coordinators for the subsequent offering of the of dips where you can actually do the entire thing so here you have designed only one module but you will do the facilitation for the entire a group of learners from your remote center as a course coordinator up as a course coordinator there are multiple aspects that you have to look at but we are providing you the skills to become a course coordinator for a specifically for every piece but you could use the same skills to do any of the blended a books to integrate moocs in your own art teaching learning process you would need the same exact skills so what that courses about how do you set up local activities to improve knowledge of the learners so this is what you would require when you are integrating moocs into your own curriculum so we hope that by the end of this particular if dtype you will get those essential skills and you will exhibit those skills by fazil facilitating mentoring to a mentees from debbie to let me now look at the next question arm so the next question yes deepak materials yes will be providing them are to you please provide a clear document the document will be uploaded in a three hour so this is the first office our interaction is to motivate you to why you should take up a hefty three what all you will encounter in aberdyfi so this is a kind of up pizza or a small brief introduction to the entire process of a if so there is a question can there be a possibility that participants are from the same institution as mentor yes there is definitely a possibility that some of you may get mainte a mentees from your own institution but are then what you will have to ensure is that whatever interactions that you make it should be recorded in some format that is essential for letting us know that you have had your interaction so how are we supposed to interact with mentees ah yes a just like a last time you are free to interact with your mentees through multiple formats the format could be chosen by you are but what we need is at the end of in your journal or please make sure that you note the different interaction that you have had or try to provide evidences that you have sufficiently interacted with your mentee
