so yes you could use your core journal to record these interactions and let us know that you have a you have actually done the required interactions what are the major differences between a flippy ones own accent usa onyx we attended and correctly currently ongoing so in terms of content there is no major difference we have added few new content given a roughly polished some areas but what does we have tried to introduce in the safety is a concept denisa breakout activities when they actually come for the synchronous interactions using it so what we do is we provide them with a local activity are at the remote center on saturdays afternoon or so will give them a focused activity where they have to create something using whatever they know from the left and in the next day what we do his will ask the course quota will group them into a hot group all the arses into multiple groups and will do a breakout session a between nazis soap a darrell we have identified eleven groups are with each group having nine to the nazis and these are sees will present whatever work they have done locally to the others are on sunday a forenoon session they will interact they will or ill ask all the questions that they have they will try to elicit all the a different problems that theyre facing and try to elicit solutions for them are using their peers again the concept is that synchronous interactions are meant not for a one way transmission but for active learning where you engage your students in discussing among themselves and learning making them learning from each other so this is a very dramatic difference from the earlier offerings of dippy one and if dippy too where are the synchronous interactions were more about one way transmission of knowledge from ati bombay to multiple hubs how will you give ten percent of mars which is related to mentio year either by mark even to their ear or performances of the mentee er doc etc so over here we have a very simple formula what we look at is the entire activity suppose it is for one point you will get one full mark if your mentee scores a mentee score in ohio is above fifty percent which is actually the pass criteria for a free ride so if your mentees ohers corso the mentees who your score is out of a believer twenty if not mistaken so there were six rubrics a or twelve whatever it is so let us assume that the voyeur is valuated out of twell so if your mentees score above six that a score above fifty percentage of the hotel or your score you will get full mark for your ra meant is we are activity and dab if your mentees not scoring above fifty per cent then you will not get that mark switzer basic zero or one and we will use ten percentage of that towards the final evaluation
