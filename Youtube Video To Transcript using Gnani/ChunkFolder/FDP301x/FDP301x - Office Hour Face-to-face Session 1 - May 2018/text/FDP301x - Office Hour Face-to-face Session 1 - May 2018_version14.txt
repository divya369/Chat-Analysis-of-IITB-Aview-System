people actually plays a vital part in enhancing your ra a tea bag so we will factor that in our final evaluation of your mentorship but if so then it may so happen that you may not get a mentee from your discipline but what you can actually provide them is a provide them more about how to use a particular technology what kind of pedagogy you can use a bell and assuming that their content knowledge is abreast or is up to the mark and they know how to use a how to use so their pedagogy content knowledge and technology content knowledge are what you say a is satisfactory as a scene from every one or the interaction still if dippy too so this is a the mentees will be assigned a primarily looking at discipline but they may be cases where because the wide variety or the diversity of audience sometimes a does not permit us to actually provide you with an appropriate one to one mapping of your discipline but please make sure the mentoring effort regardless of whatever discipline they are from the mentoring efforts almost uniform so you should nudge them towards a achieving the tea bag it is not you are giving them helpful hints where to look at what questions to consider how do you do evaluations arm all these things are being provided by the mentors of mentor is like a guy he will just show them the way you dont have to take your mentees all along the way you are expecting your mentees two avenue once you show the way you are expecting the mentees to follow the paths that is shown and a go through that particular path so you can show them multiple different paths to achieve the goal and they can decide which path to select it is essentially like arm in your own case a all the students that you teach a each of them would be learning lets say somebody from a computer sign somebody else is from a chemical engineering each of them will be learning some specific skill from you and you are actually a empowering your students to learn a particular skill maybe skills like articulation how do you do problem identification how do you articulate your solution how do you design your solution etc so these are some important skills and the discipline or domain is merely one instance in which you actually show them how do you do it but it is these skills that they use after the end of their professional course that is actually useful for them are in their life so there are cases where a mechanical engineers may not go to a work a problem or a domain of work which has anything connected to mechanical engineer but during the course of four years that they are in a they are taking their mechanical engineering courses you have taught them about problem solving how do you define constraints are what kind of a how do you look for formula from where can you gather these a different knowledges how do you integrate them how do you apply them for a particular problem so these are the skills that you teach your learners not exactly so this is a bit more than your domain you actually teach your students these kind of skills and that is what is expected from you as a mentor that you provide these skills how do you look for solutions how can you better utilized a particular technique
