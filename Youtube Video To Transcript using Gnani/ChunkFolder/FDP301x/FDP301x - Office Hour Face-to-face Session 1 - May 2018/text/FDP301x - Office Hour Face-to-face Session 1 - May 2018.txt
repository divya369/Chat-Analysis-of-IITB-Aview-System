created a group of mentees arm who would or with whom you could interact and we also had seen lot of benefits of this interaction wherein a wherein we have seen that the overall performance of the participants in the fd improved drastically abby had a so the the first offering of depot where the top two fifty crib a performers were selected a had marks more than eighty four percent we saw that the stock performance has increased to ninety five per cent arm which suggests that the mentorship had its own a gym and an important role to play in this if so but again there were lot of adhoc instructions that had to go due to lot of constraints and the there were many times what has happened is that the moment we schedule a set up abu interactions for mentors and mentees are sometimes the mint is do not actually turn up a mentors have to both mentors or mentees lose precious time due to technical glitches etc so are we understood that they need to be a formal course that introduces these mentors to understand the pedagogy behind supporting a mentees when they have to actually play the facilitation role are in this era where multiple technology features are available to them so the same could be told of a job while you are facilitating moocs or massive open online courses for your students are then the same set of skills you would need to apply with your students such that they could better attempt the mooc activities and learn sufficiently from them there is also another agenda that we had that we have to scale up the piece so that it could reach to larger amount of a teacher audience arm and be a in india the scale is so huge that we have close to for and a half lakh teachers just in undergraduate engineering colleges and the each program we are able to cater up to three thousand to several thousand a teachers still now soup we have trained only around ten thousand teachers still now and we need more such a training programs and vinny to scale them up quickly so that they will be abreast with the latest technology offerings and technologies are also changing so are the same if the piece that you had done a currently a this may get outdated are within two two to three years because the technology changes rapidly are newer and newer technologies are coming in a students are also having access to various kinds of technologies and their interactions are very different compared to what they were maybe an year earlier so each crop of students coming into the education into the classroom are different every year now so that is something that we have received a mini teachers saying echoing this feeling that something like a generation gap that existed earlier when after letter passing out of five batches of are students that has now further gone down so every year yeah theyre actually seeing a lot of new a completely new generation with a completely different outlook towards activities learning activities and a completely different outlook towards technology coming into the classroom so we need the faculty to be also be abreast with the technology changes and we need to make sure that across the country all the faculty are provided this basic orientation or refresher course about technology integration in classrooms so one more way in which we can scale it as what if we can actually a locally run these deities are with the help of efficient facilitator so we need a good facilitators who can mentor other educators in the use of these kind of educational technology tools and hence the name mentoring educators in educational technology so as a bee learning objectives of dippy three zero one is there are five main objectives the firsts to familiarize you with the tea packed model the technology pedagogy and content knowledge model that is present in a teaching learning scenario while you are integrating technology and use this deepak model to analyze how we have defined if dtype won and left it too or they will also be mentor mentee groupings and specifically you will have a practicum or a practicals where you will actually mentor one or two groups of mentees based on their decisions are in creation of we are content as part of fulfillment of debit zero won one unique activity in this particular rep debbie that we are trying to do is we are empowering you to design an fft ppi on a topic that we have covered in a fd one zero one two zero one using whatever knowledge you have gained enough dippy tree and we also want evaluation of a mentorship hard done by you yourself are by el soliciting feedback from your mentees as well as reflecting on the various learning actions that you have done as part of the a if dtype three zero so at any point during the presentation if youre having questions please post them in the question stab of a view or in the youtube chat post that as a youtube channel will be consolidating these questions and will be answering it as we are towards the end of this interaction so how are you how are we going to achieve the learning objectives that we have set for this particular if debby so there are three basic modules the first one is about peapack we will introduce the concept of peapack by giving you an overview of the two of the peace that we are running this time and how peapack is actually a present in this if after this will be providing you with some of the best practices about mentoring online and you will be actually doing a practical implementation of mentoring by mentoring a the if the two participants one or two groups of debbie two participants arm in arm creation of their wares the third and most important aspect you should elicit reflections from your mentees sudhir be reflection on practice and there should be reflections that are informing the practice which is actually you getting feedback from your mentees an doing modifications are in your own mentoring activity so that they will be able to better create and evaluate open education resources some of the important a instructions are regarding the if dtype there will be office hours that is scheduled from two to four ppm on thursdays and fridays for the first three weeks or so will have virtual discussions like this are we have provided you with a view logins or you can do a individual login or you can do a group login if youre a if many of you are available at the same institution you can do a group login and actually create a discuss with me about the various aspects of the hefty three that is unclear to you the username and password have been shared with you earlier shoulders up apparently there seems to be have been a small mixer for all the users who had received hoover mentors or mentees in the previous iteration a you can use the same username and password that we shared with you last year for all the new a logins or for all the new mentees we have created a new abu usernames and passwords and this has been shared with you till june first every three days will be updating the course are resources so youll be given access to every pith rezero one course in iiba makes and these are the resources and activities that you have to do will be updated every three days so for example a todays the first day of the course so after this the third day is on sunday on the third day will be updating the course content are typical updation would be between five to six are on a given day so after six plm youll be able to access the new content or in itee bombay exe a course of a june one derby two fortnightly updates of resources so till june one youll be giving modular content and after june one it is like two weeks once in every two weeks will provide you our resources and activities that you can complete by ah so all the activities so this is a self paced course which means that all the activities are open till the last date of the course that is twenty seventh june two thousand etc are the details of the activities will be provided in the course calendar that is available in the course the course would start a will be available to you in your xbox dashboard at five today now what are the activities that you have to do as part of this course so there are four types of activities are in the scores are first is a course journal activity that yet we do so yes i would have done this inept dependent if debute with last year as you progress with the course you have to maintain a journal of your own and this needs to be submitted toward the end of the course the second most important activity is mentoring are based on the number of participants a inept dippy too who opts for mentorship will be assigning you a group of a one to two groups of faculty who are doing open educational resource creation this time around so the mentors need to have at least two interaction with the mentees during the duration of the course are you will have to use these interaction to clarify their doubts give them understanding about what is intended or from the faculty development program and both in terms of the technology and in terms of the pedagogy you can use any medium for this interaction so if you opt for a view then it is like we you will have to stick to schedules that are given by us so if you are if you want a view interactions are it will be very difficult to a set up abu sessions based on your convenience so that is why this time around we are giving you option to use any sort of interaction medium feet could be a your skype it could be other videoconferencing softwares like zoom meetings it could be google hangouts it could be a whatsapp based interactions it could be interactions are via email basically you will have to use at least minimum two interactions where these are you discuss with the mentees their issues and their problems and satisfactorily provide them clarity about the we are creation process apart from mentoring one important activity that will do is arm if defeat design this design activities a resource creation assignment so there are seven different modules in one end to which we have designed based on the tee pack or the tea factory or the deepak model you will have to select one of this module and a basically will be allotting you into groups of three to four participants so this time you will not be provided a choice to select who you will group with the groups will be decided by us youll be informed of your group and together this group has to create an updated design activity and upload a in the course as a resource creation assignment of course the resource creation assignments would be peer evaluated so the modus operandi of this resource creation assignment would be told you in the upcoming days but the major aspect is that please be noted that there are resource creation assignments that involve you to design an api module and the final part is the valuation on mentoring so you will be using kirkpatricks model of evaluation they will be rubrics provided and mentors as mentors you will have to design survey that needs to be filled up by your mentees and these will look these surveys will elicit a or measure the reaction and learning levels based on your rap metal internet interaction and these also needs to be submitted to us as part of the epdp three process now regarding the grading a pattern you are all familiar with the basic a grading a instruments the knowledge quizzes reflection quizzes and assimilation quizzes a with a baetis thirty ten and ten percent but the new thing that we are actually going to do is there is an updated design assessment which is equivalent to a resource creation assignment which will have twenty percent british towards the overall grade are you will be evaluated on your mentoring skills are based on the surveys that are that you have designed and filled by your mentee you will also have to submit the course journal which has ten percentage weighted toward the overall grade and its not just your mentoring process that we will look at will also look at the performance of mentees in the we are creation to actually evaluate the effectiveness of your memory so there are these seven different grading components that we will use to actually evaluate you for every petrie and unlike the previous a modules where we said that fifty percentage is sufficient for passing the course we are increasing the arm pass criteria for the course we would need more than seventy five percentage so as participants you need to score more than seventy five percentage to be eligible for a certificate from if dtype three zero ill tell you why we are increasing the a the pass criteria are the reason is that one of the benefits of the up a passing the afc three zero wonders we are going to create an advanced workshop wherein we will invite all the debbie three batsmen who have passed two idi bombay and where we will be talking about how to facilitate these fd peas locally so will train you in locally facilitating a hefty piece and so that the next time around when are we of the piece are announced you will have a pool of course coordinators who can effectively facilitate the learning process teaching learning process of a faculty development programs and we can further scale we can use this pool of a teachers to further scale the afdi programs across the country so that is why we have set a higher bar because we know that all of you have scored more than eighty percentage inept deeply one and if dtype to bear hence increasing the bar and asking you to perform to more than seventy five percent so which means that just doing knowledge reflection an assimilation quizzes are not sufficient you will have to do a either a good a job youll have to do well in all the eight components will have to do exceptionally well in all the eight components to actually achieve the requisite a pass criteria so what will be the estimated effort so the work estimation can be divided into three areas so the ruby online work for you arm which is eight hours per week which is equivalent to eight hours every week there are office hours now there are three hours to two to three hours per session which not rears its actually two hours per session arm each office hour is basically two hours every session and we would ideally encourage you to attend at least out of these total six sessions we would encourage you to attend at least on one of them so that your doubts get clarify all the major instructions that we convey would be available in this office hour sessions and these office hour sessions will also be available as the entire video content of the office hour sessions would be available in your course also you can access them at a later point of time because we are also having the youtube stream of this video then it is the interaction with mentees we recommend that you damage it is mandatory that you do at least two sessions a which totals up to two hours this is a minimum requirement from our site a maximum psi you know that the performance of mentees also factor into your greeting so you can decide the maximum amount of hours based on your your convenience so you would need a minimum of two hours of interaction with your mentees are so may be one hour add maybe in the first week and one hour in the next week things like that so this betterment interaction will not start until twenty seven that is the time we will have all the way your teams available with us and will be allotting you the teams so till the time it is only you participating in the a a in the afc three course a native bombay eggs are looking at the content over there and will also enroll you as a community tes in if deepy too so that you can actually see the type of queries you can actually see what content has been provided in a fwd are too and also in a fd be one which got over so there is a slight variation in the way in which we have actually done it so will be providing you with enrollment into a baby one handed if dippy too so that you can understand what is happening india dippy so that you could do a better mentoring at your end so let me now show you a let me now show you this if one are that we have created so this time around due to a small technical glitch the entire of dippy course had to be split into two parts if dtype one part one and damn if dtype one part two a it is the same five weeks the first three weeks was provided in if dtype won and the next two weeks were provided in a one part two so in a happy one we had a so the week one we had the standard course entry survey we explained about theft so the these videos its the same so most of the content is the same as what you have seen arm in the previous debbie does in the sequencing and ordering of this are that there is a slide the difference so in week one there was about the pedagogy of use of a ladies ladies alexis and alexis are some of the alexs have also changed so we have new resources that talk about what is internet so in fact we have also converted the textual content into a format of a lady so for example if you see or hear are the first few text explains what they are going to see when you can see your reflection spot over here which ask them a question and there is a video that follows it that explains the ah what a be answer to the reflection spot so there are some variations in the format there are some variations in the type of resources that we have used are of course the technology that we have trained them is the same a the first week others are the second week was about use of wordpress to create their own website so the same set of videos that you would have seen in the a in your own epididymis arm the second week was about screencasts so we have discussed about visual presentation are what needs to be looked at while looking at visual presentation and we have so the same video by doctor somehere that you might some of you might have seen it during every interaction and some of you would have seen this as part of your course resource disowned year in which we have offered it so again you can see that there is a taxi there is a reflection spot and there is a bead a contend that summarizes the answers to your reflection spot and all these goes to your raw course journal so the mentees are required to write or your mentees would allow the participants to this particular effort had to write these answers to the reflection spots in their journal and their journal was finally evaluated arm at a tattoo submit their journal at was for the final evaluation a this was in week three i have due to a technical glitch a barbie did not have access to modify content in the course so we had to create a separate course which had weeks four and five so this is the week four and five of the course so week four was about a learning management system a model so we had the same set of activities and videos that he had given to you earlier and in week five we had the summary where they had two they were told about how different technologies were integrated are what all we have used so there this was a five part summary and they were feedback taken from each of the a learner and they were appropriate graded activities each week there was resource creation assignments there were assimilation quizzes knowledge quizzes arm reflection quizzes etc and you could see a lot of participants a posting in the discussion forum where they were exercise these were different with different focus questions and they had to respond to them so this was about debbie bond we evthe too that is going on now are the first week we had introduced them to both digital blooms taxonomy and also the revised blooms taxonomy are the revised blooms taxonomy if he was an assimilation quiz so there wasnt for it was an extension resource it was not if people had already been familiar they need not look at it again but it is we suggested we recommended that they look at it to refresh their memory about revised blooms taxonomy the second week was about the flipped classrooms the why what and how they were learning extension resources about flipped classroom at the third week which is going to release today is about active learning which is actually the inclass segment of a flipped classroom a there will be introduced to the active learning strategies of think pair share and the peer instruction in this particular week the final week there is a slight modification will be also talking about use of evaluation adage kirkpatricks level of reaction and learning would also be told to them because they would need to do a self evaluation or get evaluation metrics to complete their we are so we will use that to actually explain how evaluations could be done and we will be looking at various are ways in which you can actually evaluate your own practice and the basically a improve your own practice based on the evidence that you collect from the ground while your doing the teaching learning practice so this is about evto again if dippy too also has a discussion forums with focus question are we will encourage learners to involve themselves in the discussion forum and share their experiences are for the first week a baby would strictly ask you do not to be in god a post anything in the discussion forum you be mere observers so as part of the activity across the next one week be mere observers of the course understand how the course has been built understand how different how we conceived the entire if defeat design how the various components are a in a form provided in the a in a very sequential format and what we are trying to do with these particular hefty piece so you would be passive observers for to this to these two hefty piece for the first week in aberdyfi three zero one and you should make a lot of reflection notes in your core journal about the entire if dtype design what has happened what did you see a what were some shortcomings which could be improved with better facilitation etc so this is something that you should be doing a while you are observing if dtype three zero won you doing the arm doing the of decreased one in the first week but will be supporting you with adequate content that will help you out in and activities that will help you out in this process so if dtype three will be totally driven by a majority of learning extension trajectories or alexis and exercise they will be a lot of small everyday activities but they be few compared to the learning extension trajectories and alexis that are required in actual matry so you could discuss what could be good scenarios you have also the experience of mentoring wants and you know the practical constraints that are involved in while doing an eft so each of you could benefit from these of observations and interactions and that is what is actually driving the a hefty three there will be lot of lorna created content in a depository so the the eight hours that we mandate sometimes it may extend to ten hours also because you will be interacting with your mentees are during the process but it is all about you learning from the process and reflecting on your own practice or with the evaluation bar set at seventy five per cent i am pretty sure that you will understand that we are taking this entire course very seriously and the please note that the sustainability of faculty development programs is one of the major goal that id bombay has and we are actually keen on bringing up a lot more of you into the of decree a platform and hope that lot more a in the coming months we have a lot more participants from the previous offerings and the current offerings of depilatory participate in a hefty three zero one we will encourage institutions to promote a participants to participate in the afc three zero one because this also provides them an opportunity to be doing lot of these activities both in their colleges and also provide services to a nearby car inst instructors from nearby colleges as well so we are looking at this particular opportunity to create the first a crop of a local facilitators who would be able to helm the responsibility of scaling up our initiatives like if the piece in the years to come so a having said all this i would also i would open the floor for discussion at this moment if there are certain questions that you have regarding the debbie i would encourage you to ask this question at this moment i will stop the desktop sharing and i would encourage you to post the questions in the question taped so that we can all take the questions from the question stab an answer see in office hours one of the major a major utility that we are looking at is the question steps we should have a structured way in which questions are asked so at any point of time you have a question first look at the question staff see whether a similar question has been posted if there is a similar question please upvote it cause we have limited time we have office hours from two to four mps and we would want most of you to be a benefit most of you to get benefit out of the office hours so during the office hours if you have seen a seeing valid questions please upvote it if they are irrelevant questions or please add a note that we will not be answering it during the office hours but will take it up if it could be answered if it goes beyond the scope will take it up and will give you an elaborate answer in a due in your ati bombay scores as a discussion or forum thread ab we will also receive for all the participants who are watching this through the youtube stream we will take up the questions from the youtube streams chat so please use the chat or comment feature in the youtube stream to post your questions are more about so there are lot of questions about what is teh pack will give you five minutes to post the questions please note please look at what has already been posted or if there is a question that has already been written please upvote it in the next five minutes please post your questions online so people are asking about documentations of the documentation so all that please note all these have been documented and will be uploaded in your evthe three course as a course handout and youll be able to access this from six pmqs today so fabian arm around between five to six mps today are in your xbox dashboard you will see the course mentoring educators in educational technology and youll be able to see this over there please use this opportunity to post your questions online if there are procedural questions are for the first to office hours procedural questions are welcome otherwise procedural questions please use the app once you get access to every priest one escorts please ask the procedural questions are in the icebox course because most of the procedures will be familiar with by the end of next week so limit your procedural questions to are the eibachs course discussion forum we have a course teaching assistants over here will be answering them in the discussion forum so there are lot of questions that are coming up i will first address the most upvoted question i will use the most upvoted question ill answer them in the order of upvotes so if you have a question and you are and it is not seen as upvoted a please note that a wheel come to it towards the end of this office hours so that is why we ask you to be very careful while asking your questions ill be exclusively looking at the question staff will collect the charts that you have posted but these would be answered in the arm cores so that all the questions that you post will be provided with answers but are the chat questions will be used or will be answered exclusively in the ati bombacks course on if depth rejuvenex so please do not post questions if you have a major question please post it in the question stab because will be using that extensively in office the source and use the youtube or chat the command service or the chat button in the youtube streaming to ask the questions i ask my team to consolidate them from the youtube comments okay so let me now start answering the questions one by one the most upvoted question in this video is a what is deepak the next is about the updated design process a logins for a fd one zero one two zero one will be shortly made after the office hour so please be patient across the next two days you will be provided logins to a be a one zero one two zero one okay so this is the first question what is a te pack so a typepad is about technology pedagogy and content knowledge now as a teacher when you are integrating technology either inside the classroom or outside the classroom there are three pieces of knowledge that you will have to use so the first one is up so if you actually look at your rab wall if you actually look at your white boat am actually going to use that right now so there are three pieces of knowledge the first one is what i call technology knowledge to this this is technology if you look at the whiteboard you can see that i created a circle so that this represents the technology knowledge so for example consider the case of a view so your knowledge of the various features of aview comes in a comes to or is what is called us technology also for example how to start video in debut how to record a session in ebu a how to use whiteboard in ebu arm so various how to use questions tab out a how to post questions in a view all these forms are what we college technology knowledge there is another knowledge that is known as the content knowledge so this is present in all the teachers are so for example i am a teacher of a lets say um a subject like basic computer science so whatever comes as my computer science or related content that is called content knowledge so anything related to computer science are the introductory computer science like how are rob arrays formed what is an array of how do you write a program how do you compile a program what is what you mean by compiling all this knowledge is something a be college content knowledge and there is a third piece of knowledge which is actually needed for you to do effective teaching learning in classroom and this is what we call the pedagogy knowledge sorry for the so there is this third part which is known as pedagogy knowledge it is about lets say you have idea of how to use a particular pedagogy up inside the classroom for example how to what is think pair share why is it used what are its advantages are these form what is known as the pedagogy knowledge that is needed for a teacher to do effective teaching learning inside the class citizen knowledge about strategies why or why a strategy has to be used all these forms your pedagogy knowledge now if you actually look at this venn diagram you can see these intersection areas so there is something known as technology content knowledge which is actually over here so this is the technology content knowledge area so for example i am using a view to teach computer science one no one to my students so i create basic slides up for might a session on computer science won one and i use a view feature of document upload to upload this and stream to all students now this is an example of technology content knowledge so how to teach a particular content or how to present a particular content using a technology feature this is what we call technology content knowledge this comes in the intersection between technology and content so i may also use a pedagogy of something like peer instruction while using a view so for example i will ask all my students to initially i pose a question in a polling mode file use a oil pose a question arm in polling and i lose i decide that i use a polling feature of a view to actually do this peer instruction and this is what is known as technology pedagogy knowledge so to facilitate peer instruction using a view i will use the polling feature in a view and i lose students to discuss with each other after they commit to the answer file know how to orchestrate a peer instruction session using it so this is the technology pedagogy knowledge and there is another important feature which is called the pedagogy content knowledge the means i will be able to tell you for which feature should i use peer instruction so this is a forum a peer instruction is useful for helping students to attain better conceptual knowledge and in my content lets say the conceptual knowledge about arrays is what students should have so i will use the pedagogy of peer instruction to teach the concept of aris and this is the pedagogy content knowledge of all it is an example of pedagogy content knowledge and there is this final big peace which we call pack which is actually use of a particular technology for facilitating a pedagogy to teach a contact so when a view is used for peer instruction to teach the concept of arrays then the teacher will be having his or her complete peapack so he he or she has to use her entire deepak what kind of feature in my view should i use are for teaching this content where multiple conceptions are there so to effectively facilitate while using technology as a teacher you would require good people and that is the skill that is the knowledge that we are trying to improve through these a refresher courses or the introduction courses of eff dippy one and if debby to your trying to sensitize you towards how different technologies could be used for various purposes and what kind of pedagogies will work well with them so this is about te pack or technology pedagogy and content knowledge or they will be learning extension resources about peapack in the first day the first three days of the course so this is not limited just about as it is not about our information transmission that have done here but i also explain how a derby videos and resources that will help you out in identifying what tea packers how tea packers applicable in our sessions so for example consider the afc in the first if we are introducing you to the technology knowledge or a technology knowledge of various technologies like moodle screencast and wordpress then you decide for which technology a which technology to use for a particular topic of your so the content knowledge is coming from you so we assume that all of you have sufficient content knowledge and we focus on providing you with technology knowledge pedagogy knowledge and the the three intersecting areas of typical pki pki and by the end of the course so a while creating we are we are trying to ensure that you achieve the te pack which is actually an aim of the course an internal name of the course too effectively facilitate instructions using a technology do not worry we will be providing you with reference documents and other helpful websites in the course this is a good introduction to you about what people like us all about the next is a procedural query how the mentees will be assigned either discipline oriented or across disciplines so are the mentees will be assigned by ati bombay as far as possible we are trying to map them with discipline so that you are mentoring would be more effective ab but we will take this fact into consideration as in weather arm because we know that knowledge of design people actually plays a vital part in enhancing your ra a tea bag so we will factor that in our final evaluation of your mentorship but if so then it may so happen that you may not get a mentee from your discipline but what you can actually provide them is a provide them more about how to use a particular technology what kind of pedagogy you can use a bell and assuming that their content knowledge is abreast or is up to the mark and they know how to use a how to use so their pedagogy content knowledge and technology content knowledge are what you say a is satisfactory as a scene from every one or the interaction still if dippy too so this is a the mentees will be assigned a primarily looking at discipline but they may be cases where because the wide variety or the diversity of audience sometimes a does not permit us to actually provide you with an appropriate one to one mapping of your discipline but please make sure the mentoring effort regardless of whatever discipline they are from the mentoring efforts almost uniform so you should nudge them towards a achieving the tea bag it is not you are giving them helpful hints where to look at what questions to consider how do you do evaluations arm all these things are being provided by the mentors of mentor is like a guy he will just show them the way you dont have to take your mentees all along the way you are expecting your mentees two avenue once you show the way you are expecting the mentees to follow the paths that is shown and a go through that particular path so you can show them multiple different paths to achieve the goal and they can decide which path to select it is essentially like arm in your own case a all the students that you teach a each of them would be learning lets say somebody from a computer sign somebody else is from a chemical engineering each of them will be learning some specific skill from you and you are actually a empowering your students to learn a particular skill maybe skills like articulation how do you do problem identification how do you articulate your solution how do you design your solution etc so these are some important skills and the discipline or domain is merely one instance in which you actually show them how do you do it but it is these skills that they use after the end of their professional course that is actually useful for them are in their life so there are cases where a mechanical engineers may not go to a work a problem or a domain of work which has anything connected to mechanical engineer but during the course of four years that they are in a they are taking their mechanical engineering courses you have taught them about problem solving how do you define constraints are what kind of a how do you look for formula from where can you gather these a different knowledges how do you integrate them how do you apply them for a particular problem so these are the skills that you teach your learners not exactly so this is a bit more than your domain you actually teach your students these kind of skills and that is what is expected from you as a mentor that you provide these skills how do you look for solutions how can you better utilized a particular technique allergy so you dont give need to give them so you dont need to spoon feed you can give them helpful suggestions you can provide them a clarity on what they should try what the approach that they are using for creation of we are and this is what is expected yes of course there are some procedural aspects that are also associated with mentorship but that is transcends beyond discipline so the procedural aspects is same regardless of what discipline is or how to write a report what kind of thing should be focused in a report so all these things are basically the same regardless of whatever discipline you are but having said all that we will try to ensure that you get the same or somebody from the same display okay so i hope ive given you a the next question was about bill teepad be taught at office hours i hope ive given so this is only a minor instruction at this but they are helpful resources that will be providing you in the course as well so there is a question regarding mentor mentee discipline that i watch a answered so there is a question on iety bombacks logins so the iiba makes logins will be provided to you o a to you in the coming two days over a period of next two days will be adding you to the course cause it takes so they are find of you will have to insult you in a batch of fifty to seventy five which and verify that all of you have been enrolled so it is a time consuming process so across the next two days we will be slowly adding you to the idea bombay excause but you will have sufficient activities in the meantime to be involved in are so that a flash to get an idea of deepak and how this is a done in the different deaf dtypes again question regarding provision to choose mentees as i said the mentees will be assigned to you the same question so see something that musiness a similar question was repeated upvoted multiply so there were different variants of the same question that was uploaded in the question step while your writing your question first make sure that a question like that already exists in the question tab so that you can upvote it and you can get immediate answer okay so that is something that you should do have a first look out for but from tomorrow onwards what we are going to do his will be circulating a survey form upfront are wherein you can ask these questions so will be collecting all these and will be consolidating all these questions and all the similar questions will be addressing so the top voted questions will be addressing a upfront and we also small sessions on that will give you some knowledge about the process okay so there is a question that a question regarding plagiarism and poor peer assessment we will ensure that a plagiarism and peer performance gets a does not get affected but ya regarding plagiarism as mentors you should also take care that your mentees have not plagiarized from any place so you should ask them from where have they got the resource or is it available in open if they access the resource which is available in web please make sure that this site the resource we one of the important way in which you can avoid plagiarism is a telling from where you have obtained it so you should ask your mentees to be careful that they do or do not plagiarize content regarding we are report it should be written in so we are evaluating the wia report submitted by your mentees so it is like a final course project report ill have to ensure that they are not a taking content from somebody else so other may harm if dtype participants from their own college there not copy pasting the content they can up obviously look at their content and get be inspired but see inspiration is a different thing and plagiarism is a completely different thing so if they have been inspired or they have used a portion of somebody elses content a kindly ask them to ensure that they have cited them or they have a talked about lets a personal communication with so and so minty this should be a provided and in that way they can avoid plagiarism poor peer assessment yes we are aware of it and yes we will ensure that the performance your performance is not affected by poor peer reviews but at the same time it is your responsibility to ensure that your mentees do correct peer review so they should abide by the she should explain to them what the rubric us you should tell them what you should look in the content too and what kind of a rating should be provided you have already done this in your own when you were doing the eff are you have created your your report you know you are familiar with the we are rubric criteria criteria still remains the same and it is also a responsibility of the a mentor to ensure that they understand the process of peer evaluation and they have a clarity on what the evaluation rubric yes okay so the next okay theresa nother upvoted question which is about can you tell us more about if defeat design okay if deep in design activity it is what you coless resource creation activities are in this particular skinny arm over the if you actually look at the depot content we have created content for each module so the first module is on model what to look in moodle a what is moodle how do you create courses and model what are the different components or activities in moodle etc the second is on a wordpress the third is on screen cast the fourth is about a flipped classroom fifth is about a be in class activities or active learning inside the classroom a then the rest on digital blooms taxonomy and there is the final component about open education resources so they are these seven modules that are be had with which we have created if dtype won and if dippy too so will be dividing into groups of three to four and you will have to select a module of your choice so either you can select either moodle you can select wordpress yes you can select a arm screencasts you can select flipped classroom you can select open educational resource but after you have selected a module you will have to design us mold cores which actually takes you through the entire stages of peapack using that module so suppose you were the designers of the modules in the afc so youll have to consider yourself as instructors of the egf dippy and you will have to design the api module arm according so you should know what kind of so that is why this idea of teabaggers important the rationale the objective of the ibdp is important you have to keep all this in mind and a set out the learning objectives for the module are create appropriate content for the module so these content could be either re purposed from our existing videos or the ones which are available in a creative commons are you should add your own assessment questions to evaluate whether the objectives have achieved so you i will also have to set up a core surveys to get feedback from learners are about that particular module so youll have to look at all these aspects in your if defeat design and you have to do this for only one module so group of four people to design a module okay so this is what are the obdii module is all about design afar if dtype module so the occupy groups the groping for the epc design would be done at eighty bombay and will be informing you what your group so this will be uploaded in the arm i tbc scores and will be intimated which group you are okay so there is a question can you clarify what is the objective and outcome for this app so the learning objectives for this if difi have already provided there are six major learning objectives a first one to train you in the mentorship process by giving you an idea about the impact model and why are you need to have employed a improve the te pack up the second objective is that provide you with exercises so that you can design your own modules of the third is about the third is about a ou doing a evaluation of your own mentoring and getting feedback to for yourself and improving your mentoring practices or facilitation practices these are the main objectives of this if the major outcomes that i see at the end of this app is that a first one you will be mentoring your mentees on creation of open educational resources so you will have a mentees who will create open education resources and evaluate the their peers in the oh yeah creation process the second major outcome is that you will design a module of this app on your own so you will consider a ideas like what should be the objective of this particular module are put up appropriate instructional strategies using a particular technology so we also encourage you also the idea so that all of you will create a small model codes are for one particular module a of this particular if dtype which contains the objectives have appropriate instructional strategies and you will have appropriate assessment a strategy is to evaluate the learning process of that module then the next major outcome that will have us at the end of life after we have identified you we upgraded you are and identified that a people who pass from this course we will have a community of learners who will help itee bombay in scaling and sustaining the afdb efforts so you you will be also we will recommend a we will be informing your institutions that you could be taken up as course coordinators for the subsequent offering of the of dips where you can actually do the entire thing so here you have designed only one module but you will do the facilitation for the entire a group of learners from your remote center as a course coordinator up as a course coordinator there are multiple aspects that you have to look at but we are providing you the skills to become a course coordinator for a specifically for every piece but you could use the same skills to do any of the blended a books to integrate moocs in your own art teaching learning process you would need the same exact skills so what that courses about how do you set up local activities to improve knowledge of the learners so this is what you would require when you are integrating moocs into your own curriculum so we hope that by the end of this particular if dtype you will get those essential skills and you will exhibit those skills by fazil facilitating mentoring to a mentees from debbie to let me now look at the next question arm so the next question yes deepak materials yes will be providing them are to you please provide a clear document the document will be uploaded in a three hour so this is the first office our interaction is to motivate you to why you should take up a hefty three what all you will encounter in aberdyfi so this is a kind of up pizza or a small brief introduction to the entire process of a if so there is a question can there be a possibility that participants are from the same institution as mentor yes there is definitely a possibility that some of you may get mainte a mentees from your own institution but are then what you will have to ensure is that whatever interactions that you make it should be recorded in some format that is essential for letting us know that you have had your interaction so how are we supposed to interact with mentees ah yes a just like a last time you are free to interact with your mentees through multiple formats the format could be chosen by you are but what we need is at the end of in your journal or please make sure that you note the different interaction that you have had or try to provide evidences that you have sufficiently interacted with your mentee so yes you could use your core journal to record these interactions and let us know that you have a you have actually done the required interactions what are the major differences between a flippy ones own accent usa onyx we attended and correctly currently ongoing so in terms of content there is no major difference we have added few new content given a roughly polished some areas but what does we have tried to introduce in the safety is a concept denisa breakout activities when they actually come for the synchronous interactions using it so what we do is we provide them with a local activity are at the remote center on saturdays afternoon or so will give them a focused activity where they have to create something using whatever they know from the left and in the next day what we do his will ask the course quota will group them into a hot group all the arses into multiple groups and will do a breakout session a between nazis soap a darrell we have identified eleven groups are with each group having nine to the nazis and these are sees will present whatever work they have done locally to the others are on sunday a forenoon session they will interact they will or ill ask all the questions that they have they will try to elicit all the a different problems that theyre facing and try to elicit solutions for them are using their peers again the concept is that synchronous interactions are meant not for a one way transmission but for active learning where you engage your students in discussing among themselves and learning making them learning from each other so this is a very dramatic difference from the earlier offerings of dippy one and if dippy too where are the synchronous interactions were more about one way transmission of knowledge from ati bombay to multiple hubs how will you give ten percent of mars which is related to mentio year either by mark even to their ear or performances of the mentee er doc etc so over here we have a very simple formula what we look at is the entire activity suppose it is for one point you will get one full mark if your mentee scores a mentee score in ohio is above fifty percent which is actually the pass criteria for a free ride so if your mentees ohers corso the mentees who your score is out of a believer twenty if not mistaken so there were six rubrics a or twelve whatever it is so let us assume that the voyeur is valuated out of twell so if your mentees score above six that a score above fifty percentage of the hotel or your score you will get full mark for your ra meant is we are activity and dab if your mentees not scoring above fifty per cent then you will not get that mark switzer basic zero or one and we will use ten percentage of that towards the final evaluation okay men tease performance are also included in the grading in how we check mentees work before the submission or you dont need to actually look at a mentees work a amid very pointedly maybe have the voyeur rubric so use the wire rubric to see whether the mentees are adhering to the major inputs are based on the rubric whether mentees are creating the odihr report using the rubric are whether mentees are citing the resources that they are from where they take up materials because we do not want absolutely any amount of plagiarism in your mentees we are so each of your mentees here report a should have appropriate citations should a have appropriate elements to actually satisfy the criterias put up in the we are rubric rubrical the same are the activity is slightly different because this time around for we are we are asking your mentees also to create a moodle course rather than allowing a free form of activity we are asking them to create a moodle course where they will upload all the necessary materials so you should give them sufficient guidance on how to create their own your report you dont have to actually handhold them aiming you left you dont have to spoon feed them with what you write so you dont have to do minute editing but what you need to give them is sufficient guidance on what all should be present in each section of the report so that they will be arm odyssey will be able to create better we are reports and they will get better and also you need to sensitize them about peer evaluation how so it is not for your a segment dont tell them i mean it is not that a mantis did a bad peer evaluation hence your mares get affected that is that should not be the criteria for a sensitizing them to arm on peer evaluation rather you should tell them the importance of peer evaluation how do you evaluate somebody elses work how what that helps them in and how should they proceed in the process of peer evaluation okay so that should be the a major focus area that you should be focusing while mentoring and wheel do not worry will absolutely look at a peer reviews grievances etc while considering what you say grading up upon the final grading process in designing moodle course can we select topic from the resource activities inability to zurvan yes so a the modules that you should select has already been divide a given so do not worry the appropriate safety design activity will be explained in detail in the iati be excause i understand that you are not you are having all these thoughts because you do not have a feel of what the contents but once the courses up and once we slowly introduce these activities are in the coming days you will have more clarity about the updated design activity up what i would encourage you to do in the first week is explore if dtype one and fifty two and see how deepak ah how it actually fits the deepak model how it improves how evthe won and if lipitor is a kata to address the deepak improvement of instructors how to check plagiarism of your mentees are basically you will have two you will have to believe your mentees a check with them whether they are uploading adhere taking anymore or resources from other places strictly crosscheck that mint strictly tell them that if they rob a report is found to be plagiarized a at the time the dirty bomb is actually looking at the looking at a the o we report a plagiarism report internatin then they will not be eligible for the certificate and whatever they dont it would be completely i mean they will not get any benefit in terms of certificate from the course and this is not a good academic practice so we have stronger plagiarism measures this time around we have removed them from removed people from if dtype one when they have indulged in the moment we have identified the dev integrin plagiarism plagiarism practices okay the question regarding discipline of mentees have already answered ah so this consultant put it in text boxes i can look at the youtube channel okay okay ill be also taking up questions from youtube so all the participants who are watching the youtube stream do not worry we have our team is working or looking consolidating the questions from the youtube stream and they are telling me these questions one by one so ill be addressing that also do not worry there is a question that every ppi threes ruin has many topics from one zero nine two zero and how will it be different from every be threes roane does not have any content from a it is not a similar content from a fd one zero nine two zero one three is aimed at equipping you to understand what if we want and if dtype tools so we are actually going deep down into the design of a bbc one and if it does not the same and hence it is different you are actually doing both learning your doing practice you are also evaluating your own practice so we are training you in multiple things at the same time so in that way if dtype three is very much different from everyone and to essentially all the of the piece is about improving your technology pedagogy and content knowledge to facilitate use of technology in classroom nowhere be specific scenario is that youre using mooc classrooms or the book setting the environment is a mock setting that is all that is different otherwise it is just like how do you give guidance to somebody in creation of a doing their project activity fee as a job as an instructor you would have lot of students coming to you working for a project we are also you have your mentees were working on their course project and youre giving them guidance on how to do this project you are not going to do the project for them instead you are giving them helpful guidance guidelines in creating the final project report a final project and final project report so that they could a better understand what is required from the peace okay so there is a question what top topic is going to be covered on in tomorrows abu session or they wont be any new topics per say but once we upload the content today and if they are so there are lot of questions so they are fined and participants are in the interaction the office hours is setup so that you could be could clarify most of the doubts of synchronicity so it is a effort for us to be so the instructors are present from here over here from two to four so any clarification or questions that you have regarding either the content or the procedure all these things are we are always available or that is why we are seeing that it is not mandatory to attend all office hour sessions suppose you have a doubt you have some query come to the office hours as a instructor i am virtually available during this office hour too personally clarify all the queries that you are happy for that is the purpose of an office hour and we will be doing that exactly tomorrow so you will have a lot of content coming up today so tomorrow you can use the office hours to give a suppose you have doubts regarding the content uploaded some conceptual clarification that are required please come to the office hour please post your question so will be uploading a survey or at the asu in the ati bombyx course where we will ask you what what type of questions you are heavy so we will address all these questions are in the office hours office hours is explicitly meant as an instructor learner interaction specifically aimed at clarifying doubts are where the instructor is actually seen or the presence is actually felt the discussion forums many of you know that the rubbish lot of number of discussion posts that get posted in the icebox course so many times the course team may not be able to actually look into all the discussions and it though even though we are trying to structure the discussion forums through queries and other things even even over there sometimes he may miss out but this is one place where we are trying to consolidate the major queries and answered how the estimated interaction efforts are executed see the content or whatever is required will require you to interact it hours across a week to actually go through the content interact with your peers for doing the alexi alexi and the everyday activities you would require approximately eight hours of effort that is how we calculate bee eaters amenities up to you how much you want to utilize the eaters so you may stop at one hour of looking through the content and interaction and you may stop at it but that will not help you out in the actual mentor mentee interaction or or in the actual depth design cause all these also have to be factored in in your design to completely understand the te pack that is a that needs to be improved so we would need lot more interaction so many of you would have greatly benefited from the discussion forum activities are in the empty ones and too that we had last year because you asked a lot of western try to solve many peoples queries and you would have actually spend more than eight hours or five to six hours that is meant that was meant in that or if that was the estimated effort for that particular if dtype per week pseudo spent more than five to six hours every week while participating in the discussion forum so it is exactly the same for you to get the maximum benefit you should involve yourself in at least eight hours of activity by interacting with your peers interacting with your mentees giving them a clarifications are giving them guidance etc okay so let me take a question from the youtube charts stream okay okay okay so there are thirteen major questions that has a year and i see that people are adding lot more questions in youtube or what is the format of kernel is it a word document or the format of the original is a verb it is up to you how you want to write a core journal so look at a hefty one and if dippy too so people who were there from inevitable one end to last year youd have written a course journal yourself so you could use the same format the format does not matter but what is important as the core channel should be a record of all the activities that you have done and you should have reflection points in it and if you look at the discussion forums youll see a lot of different formats of the courier journal that you can adopt so we are not enforcing any format or any template per say but what we ask is your course journal sugar reflection of what you have done as part of a decree and it should also contain points reflection points from what you have done you should ruminate about what you have done how does it improve your understanding so they are they are there is a video in my fd one zero one exe which talks about caution i would strongly advise you one sugared login to the empty one gyro annex part one course please go through the videos of what a core journalists and understand how to write effectively good john score jones how mentees group will be assigned i have already answered this what will be the criteria used to group the participants there are no criteria to the random a random grouping i will try to ensure that no two people from the same institution are part of the same group that is the minimum that we are trying to do but we understand that there are lot of participants from multiple institutions will be a job as far as possible will try to avoid grouping of participants from the same or institution is it mandatory to ave you only to interact with mantis continue skype yes so we are not offering a view this time for ram interment interaction because we have seen that it led to lord of slot scheduling issues logistics issues so you could use any other interaction mechanism other than a view to interact with your mentees we got the chip a all the procedural code evidence regarding previous if the piece i will not be answering that what is the basic difference between the current and old ones have already explained this is about mentoring and not about learning some technology or how to use the technology effectively but you will be actually using some technologies effectively a during the course and we will help provide your content on how to reflect well or how do you deflect from practice what you need to do to improve your raw reflection process as a teacher how many mentees will be allotted to one mentor a as far as possible they are we are trying to limit the number of mentees to a four to eat and not move so unlike last time were you had fifty a mantis at this time around will have a lesser number of mentees to actually mentor in the session you mentioned few points you are not familiar with the ah so whatever i have told today that will be appropriate content in the course to actually tell you about the tell you about the details of those particular terminology or jargon will twentyseven be june deadline for reflection phases also yes so for all graded activity in this course twenty seventh june is the final due date so there is a question that please allocate mentees who are active and doing wire so that theyll be they will respond to us we hope that most of the empty two participants are active so in case your mentees not active and does not submitting we are please do not worry at all a be will factor in some kind of alternate mechanism to include the ten percentage in some way will try to factor in activeness of the mentee and whether they have submitted completely but having said that you should also try to make your mentees more active or not because you are being graded but because a because it is a process for them to learn so think of this as a scenario where you are trying to encourage backbenchers in your class to study and submit a study well and do well in exams write the exams submit an assignment course assignment think of a similar scenario we are very much aware of the practical constraints arm that are involved while doing this entire process so we will definitely consider those exceptional cases where the mentees are not active but having said that it is up to you to make sure that your mentees are active and they understand the process level okay so there is again a similar query that some mentees are only meant for working towards certificates so consider the same scenario youre facing that even in your raw classrooms as well most of the students are only worried about the final exam or the assessments and the arm btec certificate or the uji certificate that comes after passing the exam how will you encourage your london isnt a problem that we are all trying to solve what all strategies will you try to coax these learners too get the crux of the activity that is part of a fd be and what it improves you all know about active learning methodologies can you use active learning methodology in your mentorship as well will it produce vessels so why dont you think of innovative ideas where two or three of the mantis come together and do a combined session to all there are also two or three of you come together and do a combined session to all your mentees make them interact with each other will it be useful think of innovative ideas that you can bring into mentorship ameen you are not limited by a mandate that you should only have one to one interaction with your mentees so one important thing that we want you to understand is the arm connectivity model or the community learner model how you learned as a community how do you learn from each other this is how do you collaborate with each other how can you better utilize collaboration now it varies from context to context but can you look at this as a mechanism where you can try out some innovative practices now many of you would have tried out think pair share in your own classrooms and youd have seen many people are interac many students interact with you when you do think pair share can you do something like a think pair share a with your mentees you give them a problem to think make them interact with each other try to make illicit multiple views about it and finally shared with other menti groups of mentors whom you know so can you leverage the collaboration opportunity that you have with mentors in the current if debby and make the learning more so ship what all diferent strategies will you use as a mentor and this is why i said if dtype three is different from if dtype won and if deputy okay four raw this is more of a a operational query form internet interactions how to record a document timing details discussed and mode of interaction you could use multiple ways of recording a one way that if your having an interaction through an online medium why dont you open a screencast and record the entire interaction and upload it in a youtube now as part of the fft any resource created from the of dips in creative commons and all participants by is a virtue of registering to the epc have approved that all the resources meadows etc are part of the abc are will be released in creative commons as have all agreed to this particular criteria so why dont you do this do a screencast of the interaction and the uploaded in youtube of course with the permission of your mentees making them realize that this is there and if they are unwilling to show their face you can ask them to arm arm stop the video and just the audio capture or the chat capture would be good enough or if you are if you have sufficient technology to do a youtube swimming you can ask them to join the youtube stream you could do hang out with them they are a lot of mechanisms available to record all these interactions worst case why dont you give a moodle course are add to them and you are enrolled your mentees in the model codes and a use the chat module in model to interact with so this entire chart is recorded in the model and you can get feedback from the mentees about the entire mentor mentee interaction so you have learnt all these skills in the epdp iwonder if deputy what we are looking at is how well are you utilizing this in if dtype three how interraction between mentor and mentee will be analyzed see interaction what we mean is that ukip interaction one way of analysing is have you done the interaction the other way in which we will see the benefit of the interactions in the way in which your mentees create their wears and how they do peer evaluation these will be indirect indicators of how well they have done interaction other mentor mentee interaction a kindly arrange focus moodle site administration session for providing support to men piece for debbie to zero annex a she you need to use moodle only as a teacher you dont need to use moodle as a very advanced user whatever technologies you learn so you have learned about wordpress you know how to create a site you have learnt about screen casting you have learnt about the basic operation of wood model as a teacher continues these essential skills and of course you know about interaction how to do interaction using various technologies so this is a test of you using all these technologies that have learnt in a fd be won and if lipitor and which for which you have scored very high because you are all the top performers in a fwd you on an idf deputy so why dont you try to adopt whatever skills that you learnt in this real life scenario together the question what if i belong too easy and i wanted to do my ohio in engineering education a sea thus there is no we are creation in this particular app this app is all about a mentoring your a mentoring practices and design design of if dtype modules so there is no concept for your mentoring your rap mentees in creation of a year you are not creating a new year some of us did not attend deaf dippy too zero oneness a psy op i believe these are participants from the first offering of evthe ady of dippy icity zerozero annex the same offering was split into a deep one and fifty two are in a last year so the course content that you have a gone across enough as it is the same over here also is there any reason behind making this if dtype paid ah yes the rationale is that are the mentors yourself last time you had provided the other two important rationale or the first is that a the services that we are providing as part of a this particular effed up the benefits to the participants of this app is higher we are making you mentees and you we are officially putting you as our proxies are in in an empty because that is actually running now we are telling all the participants in the current of dpi that these people are like the people who know in and out of what an we are as they have done this activity last year in the end theyre offering they will help you out in the process of we are creation arm a ben you are doing the course project so this involves some amount of commitment from you so be we do not want any of you to go a completely omit the mentor mentee interaction and one of the mechanism through which we will ensure that you know the complete arm thing is that by making a this epi pet cause going ahead we need to make the safety three self sustainable and there are lot of services that needs to be offered there are lots of ancillary services that need to be offered a job to you in setting up a providing you with appropriate guidelines platforms with all these office hour sessions etc for which there needs to be up ownership from your and also an a by making this page we are ensuring that you take up the ownership of a hefty completion or the goals of the seabee on yourself how will you take the attendance for this episode there are no attendance mechanisms are in this app if it is you provide evidence that you have interacted so we may give you specific things like survey forms etc where you will interact when you did the interaction a where have you uploaded the ab interaction records of your interaction a hoover the mentee who came for the interactions etc that you may provide but other than that we are not keeping any attendance we are keeping a tab so even for review though we have a record of all the people were coming in every interaction we do not have any idea of which all users come to us via youtube so i see the office hours are meant for your benefit and a we are ensuring that you understand the you take up the ownership of these activities yourself and if there needs to be clarification and other things we will ask you will be coming for the office hours and getting these things clarified but since that you have paid us it is our responsibility that we provide you with the most clear cut instructions so you can demand the service that is we provide more clear documents we provide more clear instructions and we have a course to a team so be we have three of my colleagues over here are two of them are here with me right now a lucian and david are they are part of the education technology department at idi bombay and theyll be assisting me are there be the a taste for this course will be the main course staff will be answering many of your discussion forum queries and will be setting up these materials are creating most of the curation work would be done by them and there is one more a harem who is part of the art the itee bomb extreme over here is a projecting less assistant a a with the department of computer science or hear project research assistant and he will be a hewill be the third tee for this course together is a question arm about face to face communication for this episode the group formation would be done at the end of week want so the entire week one is provided you to explore the hefty one and a flip the current offering of hefty one and fifty two and the kind of questions and activities done by our students in this particular if deep in the participants in this particular evty so use that for the first ebc so by the end of this week will set up the group and will be informing you again you can use for the communication you can use these online vacancy it is about use of educational technology i am communicating to you using abu so this face to face communication wherein i come in one place and you are also available at the same place so its not the face to face it the synchronous communication that we are focusing on and the what we are encouraging us there is lot more lot more than synchronous communication that is currently happening you extended to multiple mechanisms and the use that mechanism to interact with your peers colleagues extensively use the discussion forum i use other modalities to interact with them okay so there is another question regarding so the question is if i use whatsapp to interact with my mentee will have the same mark as the mentor who is interacting with his mentee using em yes the women we are not limiting the mode that you should use you we know that by the end of day one and a flippy too you have all got a gathered sufficient proficiency in use of multiple technologies so and you are also apart from the app dependent to you use a lot of other technologies as well so use a mechanism that is convenient to both you and your mentee sometimes employment is not very proficient in whatsapp that interaction may not be very fruitful or diamante does not prefer whatsapp that interaction may not be very useful also you need to take the permission of your mentee to interact in whatsapp so you should look at the ethical considerations also while choosing the mechanism of interaction what we will give you is will connect you to your mdt so ill tell you that seo an seo person is your a mentor for creating a we are and will tell hell tell them that they will help you out in the we are creation process you can ask your questions clarifications etc to your mentor about the entire we are process a some participants register but do not do any submissions or are always late for submission how does the mentor help them in such case are for participants who are delayed due to submissions you can remind them of the due dates when the submissions are due what kind of activities are more important you can send them reminder emails if they are in touch with you using any of the other modalities can inform them ya todays the last date or a fine so is the last date for this particular submission you should focus on doing that if they do not do the submissions at least we know that you have tried your level best but are your mentees were not cooperating with you so ill factor that in your grading while doing your grid so do not worry about okay so there is a question peer assessment is really a problem and there is no solution afterwards for wrongly assessed assignments this is not really true agents there are solution mechanism so we have core support team or teams who will be looking at these wrongly assessed assessments anvil a would be able to provide you with console is a producing river a improve the breeding policy i mean look at the wedding policy and give you a correct assessments together the question that epdp rejuvenex seems to be more as integration of technology pedagogy and content if so please explain a bit more off so i hope i have answered your question but if you have more doubts regarding some specific acts aspects about how technology how pedagogy and content gets integrated more deeply please post this as a main concerts while address this separately tomorrow or for the current thing the detail is that you will be utilizing whatever technologies and pedagogies that yep learnt you already have the content knowledge that is how to use different technology so the content knowledge is the content knowledge of dip one end of dippy too we all know that you have that in a pub a plenty because you scored more than eighty percent in everyone and if so we arranged a by this we are ensuring that you have the content knowledge but it is the technology and pedagogy so you need more practice to show your technology and pedagogy skills that have gained from everyone and if dippy too so this is an opportunity for you to actually bring those into practice a is it possible to provide an example for implementation of the impact we have resources for this app please go through the a atibaia scores on every pith rejuvenex itll be a open at around five pmqs today arm after which you could see a the course contents up we will be enrolling you too so if you actually look at if dip the we are activity that you are suppose to do that exactly is a technology pedagogy and content knowledge will have to exhibit how you use a particular technology what pedagogy your using and are for teaching a particular content so that the we are is the greatest example of the deepak but more details some more concrete examples i will be a will be providing it through other resources if that is not sufficient in the coming days will be uploading more such examples so what are the new things that you learned i hope i have answered that question right now you will learn about mentoring and you know learn little more about a kirkpatricks evaluation model land deepak which is actually useful for you as a loner almost answered the questions related to te pack year south about how to interact with mentees have already informed a lady material is not yet posted a we do not have a ladies ladies are basically the office or sessions are that you are having right now so this is the two way interaction between the learner and instructor re no separate or ladies for the course so i hope you have already seen are the obsession plagiarism issue again you can at most guide them on how to cite and remind them that they should not copy word by word from somebody elses report a okay in the induction programme promo photos at the mooc platform is going to be dedicated on twenty sixth january two thousand eating soap are due to some technical issues we have the platform ready and see the ati bombacks code is an its fronted the drupal code is available in open source so if you go to wikibooks not in a below in the below a credits section you can actually see the git git code for that particular wrap for our i the bombacks a installations a if you have a system team capable arm who could use develop and maintain the platform adherent you this is completely free and open source technology you could use that is the same as creating a mooc course know this is not same as creating a mucus but rather how you interact with a books a war the mentees your mentees are participants from the current offering of debbie to zero one okay a with the communication can be make out that if you will be given to volunteers and will get slot from i know so unlike last year what we have seen is that every interactions the logistical issues too high and you may not get the mantis at the same time so we are giving you a option to use mechanisms that are convenient for you rather than sticking to use of ebu check sorry for the audio interruption arm so that the question can be a mentor and mentee um no you can only be a mentor mentees as in if you want to learn from others feel free to collaborate with other mentors in this a gift so theres no separate a meaty role for you in this particular api so that the question was another question was a guides how to create dashboards like ai to be an a about tell about working up working group a city these are topics beyond the scope of the current evthe three but you will be intimated about this in due course of time because we are something that is something that we are trying to so once we have a community that is when the idea of working groups make more sense so your trying to build this community through this so all of your part of the working group in essence the sense that you are all working towards improving the wee hours of your off the if the participants in that way you are part of the egf dippy a working group a but yeah details of this a is currently beyond the scope of this program so let us limit to the scope of the program to discuss can more than one mentor guide one mentee yes all such innovative practices are welcome but ensure that there is only single point of annecy we introduce one mentor to the metal so it is important that when you involve another mentor also in the process you introduce them to the mentee and tell why they have been up why are they part of this mentality interaction by so too should include multiple groups only when you are having multiple groups involved then only it makes sense that one onto can learn from multiple people are so regarding submissions we will try to accommodate maximum as possible but see every program has certain a mandate under which it works so submissions under due date is very important and so if you are registered for a program submissions within the due date is paramount for you to take the best benefit out of it in terms of certificate but in terms of learning you as you know see a if you have learnt sufficient you will know it yourself certificate is only of what you say a technical document that you show some others either for career advancement or show that this is how what a ighty bombay has given me so i hope you will not work just for certification but it is also for the knowledge improvement and please maintain the due dates otherwise it will be hard for us too in in improve a include you in any of the a further additional efforts cause all these are programs done under certain mandate and we are giving you sufficient time to do the activity and even for the meantime there is sufficient time to do the activity so how to give provide betterment interaction proof i hope ive already said that you can record or you can do screen shots any of this is good enough yes so i agree that if the mentors and mentees from same domain and will try to do that but the diversity so high that we cannot assure you that you will get a mentee from the same domain how will you take attendance was i said attendance for the safety is not a mandatory thing it is completely online with office hours office hours is the blend interaction and there are no mandates a per say regarding attendance so if you want to skip an office hours your free to do that but it is in the office hours that maximum queries will get personal attention from the instructor contents will be uploaded by five pmqs today and the course will be up reflection points and if the petry see reflection it is about what you have done so you may have gone through a content so how is it applicable in your scenario what have you learnt from it so this is what we mean by reflection on practice and reflection a improving practice so leather you understood about deepak model you write that in the caution and how does your knowledge of deepak model improve your own practice so let us say you learned what ibakas how will it help you in better are guiding your mentees that is something that is reflection informing practice format of original there are no specific format you are free to choose the format that you wish to use is there a tool to provide a check plagiarism no soap or see a major problem with the plagiarism checking tools is that all of them has institutional licenses assau we unfortunately will not be able to share the aternity login with any of you are because it is a it is very specific to ati bombay but if you have some other plagiarism checking software up amid we do not mandate you that you should check the plagiarism of the a mentee submission all we expect is that you provide them sufficient warnings sufficient guidance on how to avoid pleasures so all the questions regarding uploading of content has been answered documents will be uploaded please do not worry as the passing criteria is empty five percent kindly do not keep anything in peer assessment as a wrong or casual approach will affect the sincere efforts of the participant or we will be trying out a different type of appear assessment in this particular epidemic more details i will not be discussing right now because there is too much of information at this point so i want you all to focus on the tee pack and how they are one and two have used the deepak knowledge are in the coming week so please do not get worried about wrong peer assessment inventory there is a very a different format that we use for peer assessment this time out so just be inform that year and one important thing is arm the greats of the activities so you do not have to look at the progress bar for the so the progressbar is only an indication of some the activity completion it is not a true reflection of adi activities that laughed at because theyre a lot of offline activity so for example you are submitting your core journal it will be evaluated by core stuff over here that is not part of the a atiba makes major process so there are a mix of offline evaluation and online evaluations and will be taking care of these issues of assessment etc i in our evaluation process are we expected to go through complete of dip one end to their own you need to go through the content do not participate in a deep one and two as of now so please be warned please do not engage in doing ing activities enough dippy one and two are because that you not get any benefits of a ftp one and two certificates a bot you what we want you to look at is how the activities have been designed that is what we are looking at from a by enrolling you enough if we wanted to clarify the judgment with mentees presentation for all activities with a soft copy for an individual mentor i do not understand what you meant but is it a if its explanation of parp mentees op performance then yes the rubric will be telling you clearly about how the mentees performance was enough dippy three do you need to create we are so you dont need to create we are forever debbie three we are assignment there are no separate your assignments in a typically they are very targeted assignments but you may use all these technologies like moodle screencast etc to actually make the best use of digital time is very short year unfortunately time is very short but that is all that we get so we cannot have a very sad constraint under which we are all working but within the time constraints will be looking at the performance within the time constraints will be definitely factoring that arm while doing the grading process if the mentees do not do we are assessment have already informed you that it will be how to get the presentation of mentees soap there are no separate presentations per day will be evaluated about their we are by their own arm by the other peers from if so do not worry about judging of evaluation of amenities why most of the lecture videos on youtube are published standard youtube license at least this time around will try to ensure that the studio team will modify the license of the videos but a standard ascent a mean please note that all the videos that we create right now is in creative commons oil check with the studio team to ensure that while they are uploading the video are they change from standard youtube license to a creative commons there seems to be lot more questions but i am actually overshot the time for office hours today please do not worry if your questions have not been answered till now my course team is taking all these queries consolidating them and will be providing you answers through multiple formats either will start with answering most of the queries in the coming days are in the next office or interaction and will also publish the answers are the questions answers or that have not been done through a view or in the icy bombay excause okay so please do not worry at this as i said the office hours one more mechanism to come up with a increasing interaction between mentors and mentees as you i know all of us are working in a time constraint but will try to maximize our ra to maximize the productivity of office hours i would encourage you to upvote use the quest
