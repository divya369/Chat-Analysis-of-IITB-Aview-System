get the crux of the activity that is part of a fd be and what it improves you all know about active learning methodologies can you use active learning methodology in your mentorship as well will it produce vessels so why dont you think of innovative ideas where two or three of the mantis come together and do a combined session to all there are also two or three of you come together and do a combined session to all your mentees make them interact with each other will it be useful think of innovative ideas that you can bring into mentorship ameen you are not limited by a mandate that you should only have one to one interaction with your mentees so one important thing that we want you to understand is the arm connectivity model or the community learner model how you learned as a community how do you learn from each other this is how do you collaborate with each other how can you better utilize collaboration now it varies from context to context but can you look at this as a mechanism where you can try out some innovative practices now many of you would have tried out think pair share in your own classrooms and youd have seen many people are interac many students interact with you when you do think pair share can you do something like a think pair share a with your mentees you give them a problem to think make them interact with each other try to make illicit multiple views about it and finally shared with other menti groups of mentors whom you know so can you leverage the collaboration opportunity that you have with mentors in the current if debby and make the learning more so ship what all diferent strategies will you use as a mentor and this is why i said if dtype three is different from if dtype won and if deputy okay four raw this is more of a a operational query form internet interactions how to record a document timing details discussed and mode of interaction you could use multiple ways of recording a one way that if your having an interaction through an online medium why dont you open a screencast and record the entire interaction and upload it in a youtube now as part of the fft any resource created from the of dips in creative commons and all participants by is a virtue of registering to the epc have approved that all the resources meadows etc are part of the abc are will be released in creative commons as have all agreed to this particular criteria so why dont you do this do a screencast of the interaction and the uploaded in youtube of course with the permission of your mentees making them realize that this is there and if they are unwilling to show their face you can ask them to arm arm stop the video and just the audio capture or the chat capture would be good enough or if you are if you have sufficient technology to do a youtube swimming you can ask them to join the youtube stream you could do hang out with them they are a lot of mechanisms available to record all these interactions worst case why dont you give a moodle course are
