going for empty three as well yes so what will be the tentative timing of empty three or so there is little premature to say the spa but the debbie third will actually be around may seventeenth will start around may seventeenth for twenty third are the brochure is being prepared will have to look at logistics but one thing from a one thing that is going to be different enough dippy threes that they are not going to be weakened interactions will be keeping office hours so participants can either individually look at the office hours from our youtube stream or they can as an ar see if there are lot of a participants in a bbc three from a nazi they can use the ebu facility within the aussy to actually connect to our arm off if dtype three classroom error case if you hit that impede zero monarchs an a be tree will be going on simultaneously as you mentioning the deed every seventh yes yes so but if debbie three is only for those people who have successfully qualified if dip one end of depth to the previous iterations for the participants will be different okay thank you so much easier and down one clarification regarding womanhood our tenure so the instructions will be from may three to thirty one of the owners of patients will happen somewhere around mid june or the sec a first week of june another be evaluations happening during the third week of june and usa and it is good that as you mentioned that you be checking out the academic calendars of different universities attend schedule this empty ones zero minutes at a more conducive timeslot in the coming time because i felt as artsy coordinator that menu to faculties couldnt follow because of their hectic routine and wish to complete it successfully but they were literally struggling with the time i completely understand oh yeah so the same one thing is that marketing that we have known right now is that if dtype won zero one can now be given as a self paced course for most of the faculty so the next offering of aberdyfi won zero won the may have a self paced course are also so that faculty can take it up at their own convenience and do the activities only things that peer evaluation has to be synchronized so theyll have to give appropriate will have to work out some mechanism through which the peer evaluations will be done by the ceramic the mission young cincinnati one two nine to yeah i would like to really thank geikie bombay for this wonderful course i myself registered as a participant as well as ways to get the entire feel of the goods along with the rest of the participants yeah so we try to do it honestly and thank you so much was a wonderful learning experience for you and make sure that if ever i hope that youre qualified for episode one where my grades are nine points but since i met from computer science background i did a mistake i shared incorrect url why i had prepared the web a web page as well as model completely and i did the entire thing very honestly and i had a great learning experience memory and no problem so ah so nine points us in your job is it ninety per cent or is it point zero nine point nine point nine so that means your qualified for early be mine so do participate through participatory happy about ya so do participate congratulations and do participate in early beta also okay definitely sir its a paradigm shift i feel for all the faculties were not using icity tools and in todays scenario in order to keep spooned engaged and to make art eating very interesting it is the need of the time so its a wonderful course
