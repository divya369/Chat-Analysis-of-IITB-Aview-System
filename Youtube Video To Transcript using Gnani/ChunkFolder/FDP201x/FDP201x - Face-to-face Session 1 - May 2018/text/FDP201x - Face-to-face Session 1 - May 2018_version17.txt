you are welcome to create interdisciplinary topics but what you also have to ensure is that whatever topic you choose there are people to evaluate so creation of voyeur is not the problem the problem is in evaluation of new york so you whatever interdisciplinary topic you take an oh yeah you should find us a capable person to do peer review for the two year if you do not find it or if the a resource person is not familiar with that particular topic how will they be able to evaluate your yard so that is why we have we have identified fourteen domains and we are asking you to create resources in these fourteen domains so that youll be able to identify a a what is a suitable peer evaluator for your ra oh yeah yeah okay arcy one one three one wall sconce with morning sun with money this is with respect to the contents of flipped classroom which are the contents secondly we have deliberately understood how muslim has to be conducted there how men and now at present we are in a scenario where we have an open ended admissions morden engineering colleges in so many engineering colleges and the number of students are listening to this situation learning can only happen if we adopt methods like simulated annealing a reinforcement which will bring the student to be really heated and hammered in terms of learning and then the concept goes into the mind bes particular students know and we have a method which probably we have used without using icity a method call dents teaching by example a wherein i take a pre test which is a one minute test to see what the prerequisites the student knows then i each them without giving an example then i get the results of the test by having another one minute test then i pitched them the same concept giving an example and then i get the results again by one minute tests and by this particular experiment i found that learning has happened in a better big i have one suggestion here that since itey bombay hall ways lying and planning to have new things and innovative things can be used this particular practice in your flip classroom such that videos are created by teaching a concept without giving an example followed by a video which is created by giving an example in it and then learning at the end of a particular session is going to be understood what this i feel that what we are aiming at developing foundation and conceptual knowledge to be imparted in students may definitely be i would like to have your suggestions regarding this particular aspect yeah so its a first of all its an interesting suggestion so what are from archive on one tree one what has been suggested as can we teach using examples and he has followed a systematic procedure through which he has ensured effectiveness of this particular method and what i want all our seas to take from this is how you can do systematic evaluation of your own practice so a good works or what your doing is actually very op what is there a systematic process of actually evaluating your own practice
