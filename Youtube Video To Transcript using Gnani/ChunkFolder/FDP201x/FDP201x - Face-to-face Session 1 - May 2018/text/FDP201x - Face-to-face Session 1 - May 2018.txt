perhaps a websites using wordpress so all you have done on lord of form creation activities using technology were so you were exposed to various technology resources and various ways in which you can work with now that alone is not sufficient when it comes to actually doing what is a teaching learning with these technologies you also need to know the pedagogy for using the technology pedagogy for using the appropriate affordances of the technology and the you should know how it all fits into your local context now as you know learners are very different and they are very diverse and each context or the effectiveness of the technology depends on learners are the learners attitude learners prior knowledge how how well you can arm get a rapper with these learners their beliefs so all these are a pretty important so you should apart from knowing the pedagogy for using technology you should know how to do that in your own local context so teachers need to learn and practice facilitation skills abusing icity to blend instruction in their own classrooms now debbie toshiro won is primarily meant to ensure they are to equip you with this facilitation skills and in this we solicit teacher collaboration with teachers should be able to share the best practices review a amin reviewing off each others lesson plans or content and refining practice so that they can refine the practice is pretty important and that is why we need to create so the a the main purpose of grouping you and making you come in the archives and making you interact with our seas among our seas is to facilitate this collaboration and a help you realize the significance of so how this course is going to unfold in week one of the course you have already done digital blooms taxonomy where are you saw how the various learning purposes across different blooms levels so ride from remembering how technology can facilitate remembering learning purpose too how technology can facilitate creating purpose how in the second week that is going on right now we will be focusing on flipping the flipped classroom where we will focus on out of class activities so focus or will be on how technology can be utilized for out of class facilitation and in the next week we will introduce you to the in class activities that should go along with the out of class segment so that your learners get the maximum benefit the final week of the said debbie will be focusing on evaluation of classroom practice are both at learning level learning and perception a evaluations and we will focus on open educational resources or we are a form we will be giving you a group assignment to create a new year little bit more details about your activities so we are can be considered more or less as a course project activity if you consider so you all know how we can all are as teachers you would be giving small mini projects to students within a course so this is called cootes project activity and this is meant for you to exhibit a skills learning are the skills at kreitler so you have learnt a lot of technology you have learnt a lot of pedagogy let us now see how you can best facilitate this are best exhibit this by creating a resource are unlike the past few offerings are this time we are focusing on creation of a moodle course and preparing a report on it as the we are actively so participants need to form a team of two to three ideally from the same are sea so that you can discuss and to be even better if you are from the same domain how a we have a list of domains are traditionally arm in which a different participants are raw gen urgently commander so these wee hours are going to be peer evaluated partisans will get two weeks to prepare the open educational resource that is the moodle course and another two weeks to evaluate your peers we are now two facilitate and handle the logistics aspect of open educational resource creation and peer evaluation what you have to ensure is that you will have to form a team and inform our work a workshop in addition he outreach our team by twenty fourth may two thousand eaten by fish and we request all the course coordinators across the arses to consolidate the teams from your remote center and inform us by the due date so that we could in the final week we could divide you into appropriate a segments and then give you the appropriate activity now what is the rationale of open educational resources are it is to build on existing knowledge so open educational resources when you keep your contents in creative commons that is one aspect of open educational resources but even more important is the aspect that you are trying to us if you have an open educational resource youll be able to build on the existing content without any fear of intellectual property of a rights amid a the attribution is still there so you give the visibility to the creators but still you will not be bound by any rules on whether this could be used whether you need to pay all those things are will not be that so that is why it is important that as a community we engage in creation of this open educational resources so over the coming two days you will get more information about the open educational resource creation activity i am currently a we just give a broad overview that it will be the youll be creating a moodle course as a group so in a group you will be doing a moodle course arm so you all know that we have two abu sessions in this particular episode be the first one today on twelfth may then be the second session on thirteenth may adi next set of interactions is on twenty sixth and twenty seventh of may the ebu is primarily meant because we need all of you to come together at the same time and we expect participants to collaborate with others both within the arses and amongst the hours so we have a lab activity today afternoon where the primary aim of the activity is to ensure that you work together within the artsy and tomorrow will have breakout sessions breakout session the team a team list is the same as you did in the last one so a in the breakout session you will be collaborating across asks what we have done us all we had had a several request where they wanted some practice time for looking at the different features of ebu so we have enabled abu groupings are right from afternoon today so from opium onwards are in your own arm abu dashboard you will see the your groups class enabled so you could interact with the other so the main teacher or sees a we had a provided teacher or seas for rob the last breakout session they will continue as teacher or seas for the current sessions as well or you could a if participants are interested in trying out the various functionalities of a view from today to a clock to five thirty this classroom will be open in todays third and fourth session on day one that is from two m to five thirty the focus is on completing a local tasks and tomorrows breakout session of the focus will be on getting feedback on the task that you did locally from other horses within your group and role of course coordinator for both these activities be is very critical because you will have to ensure that all your participants within the archive are in gauged in the task and they get appropriate feedback so they get opportunity to present their work as an archive you present the work to other office and get necessary feed please note that throughout the set we have a zero tolerance policy towards plagiarism will be checking your submissions using our turnitin a plagiarism checker and certificates are going to be dispatched only after the plagiarism checkers completed soup certificate despatch for the current of debbie a might be delayed so we have the activities and evaluations going until a june fourteenth up after that it will be roughly it will take us a month to consolidate the plagiarism check and ensure that all the participants a resources have been checked for plagiarism within our app with using our turnitin a plagiarism checker app we are expecting the certificates to be dispatched between july ten to fifteen that time window a will complete we are expecting a evaluations to be complete by the time so you may receive certificates after approximately a month after this trip is completed the instructions for the safety is our only they tell me pretty fast so the online course is available tell me that even with all the instructions knowledge quizzes reflection quizzes etc are it will be open till june fourteenth for you too are do peer evaluation of open educational resource so that we have enabled a will be enabling the course to go on for we are evolution till june what in the clue a course will close on june fourteenth arm in the meantime the plagiarism checks will start and we expect almost a month typically last time we took it took us nearly a month to complete the plagiarism check and the based on that from the past experiences we expect the same time for this thing are this offering also so thats why i said julie a tenth is the date between tenth and fifteenth the date that we are planning to give a dispatch certificates for the completed parties now another important thing are in this particular if dip is that we also have a parallel left over for facilitators its called mentoring educators in educational technology i saw the title is a ftp three zero one ex so you will be getting these evthe three zero won a participants who have completed a ft even and if dippy too in the previous year as mentors so each of you will be allotted a mentor who will also help you and guide you in hours of open educational resource creation activity are what is very important is that there will be a given access to the discussion forum so you could ask or clarify your doubts with your mentors and there will be sink a will be setting up synchronous sex sessions with your mentors through abu will be creating logins for each of you in abuse so that you could interact with your mentors now arm since aview is centrally controlled wheel have a targeted slots in which we will be able to open a view activity for a particular group but what is more important is that arm or you engage in synchronous interactions with your mentors so your are the mentors a as part of the coursework is required to engage in synchronous interaction twice with you a once during creation and once during evaluation but yeah you could use the mentors are to clarify any kind of doubt regarding any processes in the epi because theyll be having better understanding of the egf deepy processes specifically peer evaluation peer reviews etc arm as they have gone through this are in the past two offerings so that is all about the basics of this particular if debbie debbie toshiro won its what i am going to do right now is an open the floor for ra interaction questions clarifications are etc you could use the handrail button in a view to raise your questions and if they are important questions that are not getting answered as you see beal have almost a almost an hour of interaction if i am not able to reach you please post your question in the question tab of a view so that i can look at it and i can give your feedback are either in the above medium in the nexus at the start of next session or a job as a common announcement in the iati bombay escorts so if a participant these are the floor is open for interaction you can do a henrys are to interact with us a over the next one i am not seeing any henrys button okay there seems to be a question from indore institute of science and technology yellow hello good morning hello anthony talked about plagiarism i am not able to clarify that board what type of wood which resources are to be judged by we are that this plagiarism whether the model or the screencast tour death what board resources will be check for plagiarism so okay with the report which will be preparing yeah so are we will be checking a question from r see won four poufy a very good offer one for two tree is up for eight one four one four three five is that what kind of resources will be check for plagiarism will be checking your final a we are report for plagiarism we are expecting you to ensure all the appropriate citation practices within the moodle course so will not be evaluating looking at the content that you are uploading over there of course there will be your peers ool a one of the mandate of the valuation is that check whether the resources that they provided are a for plagiarism that that will be done by your peers but at iety what we are going to do is the final submission which you submit as courts project report will be checking that four pleasures okay this is arcy one three three one a birla institute of technology msra raunchy i am not able to hear your audio map can you speak up can you check a mike allow yeah okay bits mesereau you are audible but it is very low can you slightly increase either speak a little louder or slightly increase the volume allow a good morning upon put money they ask questions from the last session which was built on twenty fifth of march okay this question is from like the perfect pocket he stated very likely that if you sessions can be held and like i am a faculty in department of management okay so are we are teaching the engineering students also in strength of mind your handwritten current so a howe this sir eve you session with you which is held for a taking classes like a professor is teaching in valve me standing in one class hell the kagawa collected so with applicable or amend any be hell yes ask for a few so the question is can a view be hair held locally thats what your asking right yes yes yes the answer is yes there is absolutely no problem the ebu so you need to have an ebu server client setup so technologically what you need to do is you need to ever a team who is capable of handling ebu so ah download adi abu code a set up enables server ensure that all the appropriate technological aspects of eve you have been met with then once you are available you can use a view of for a streaming you are a class a two multiple a classrooms at the same time we are doing that right now isnt it so at the same time we are streaming to a around hundred and three classrooms across the country because we have seen your videos also and the view also told that if the video lectures can be sent to the students and they will see the video lectures in their hostel or room and the then they can come to the class a and the questions can be asked based on board with you yes so i think this can be so much easier absolute notion okay ah arcy one one zero three and a r other some audio disturbance a year please god it archery one one zero three are there is some audio disturbances am not able to clearly hear your raw there is a lot of disturbance in the a in the mike can you either change the mike and see its a there is lot of there is lot of noise in the a mike map no other there seems to be a halo arm archive one one zero three there seems to be audio noise still i am not able to even a notable to parse what your saying i am hearing your voice but there is a lot of grains like noise or can i get back you can you post your question in the question staff archive on montserrat real combative can you check your mike in the meantime okay check mike in the meantime also pose the question in the question okay arcy one zero zero five anna university chennai yellow year amount yes i would doubt about the certifications many ask about it yeah no problem though is it too certificate or its own certificate or request or how its good we did so deeply one will have its individual certificate and apdip it too will have its own individual certificate oh those were not completing a puppy to they can react and if you re your giving it back yes yes at any point yes which is two separate process yes there are two separate are certificates there are two separate courses and there are two separate certificates oh when can we expect a puppy once certificates mike i think it will be despatched in a weeks time are the ah i think the certificate process generation has happened its irrelevant it is going to be dispatched so i also am being told by the workshop team that it is going to be dispatched in a weeks time or see one tree aided art archive uncreated malmedy education foundations rajkot so can you keep the mike kloser to use i am not able to hear yes please wear your profile click the map you baby i remember when the attack was a good thing he did not often i give my question is mentioned in this one is actually in pain or improve the challenges we remain unique to me i ought to be good or okay so the question is i think i should address this in a general or for people who are not able to listen to the question there it is about the groups in we are activity now are the mandate of we are active and important mandate is that this activity has to be done in groups now it may so happen that are in a particular or see if it is indeed a based on if you divide based on domain you may not a fine people of either you may find people who are either alone or after grouping becomes aloof so what happens to a people who are left out in the archives because of palm are what you said no of people from mom a similar raw hard domain now to sort out that a issue of why we are domains we have a general domain titled educational technology so you could a look at a creating a resource on youth a how to utilize a particular educational technology two of this transcends domain so this is the first alternative to the second alternative is that if you are beef up your request for we are or ram at the request for grouping yes received early what we can do is we can find an appropriate a person from another artsy and both of you can then together collaborate to create your own and that is why one important activity last in the last if dtype was to find people from similar domains so youre a each of you post your content based on your domain and either through discussion forum or through a new interactions you find out people who are from the same a domain and try to work with them so what else can you hold my closets are not able to hear if i am not able to hear your questions if any formal meet request to you upon the group or okay to be so hard to form the group what we are going to do is around ah ah so we are going to set up discussion forums based on the different domains in eighty be exports after the same interaction the means on the fourteenth we will open up a discussion forum so that you can f are based on different domains so its called teams so you could identify people from the same domain in that particular discussion forum collaborate together and then inform your course coordinator with whom you have form the team so it is important that all course coordinators be informed about all the teams all the activity that you doing as a group so that because we will be talking with your course coordinator the outreach team will be talking to your course coordinator for the course coordinator need to be aware of made aware that okay i found a group member through this discussion forum and together we have decided to work on a single topic okay ah nextis arcy one four zero zero womens polytechnic college puducherry mornings good morning archive one four zero zero are did you close the video please wait we have prerequisites to be asked okay yes but no one is no one is already we have created models yes what is the purpose of creating model again in this puzzle so ah you have created model individual okay question number one us ah what is the purpose of are are creating needle again again again yeah fine what is your second question should the team be in the same domain or can we have different set of people okay a same domain different disciplines okay yeah you heard is will the certificate have grade a grid display demand certificate okay so there are three questions that has been asked by a or see a one four zero zero are very pertinent question so ill answer them art from a tour ard from third the two first okay so your question as bill grade be displayed in the certificate no author will not be any greed in the certificate per say but what we are doing us we are at the top performers of people who score above ninety five percent each up in both of these combined will be acknowledged as top performers of this if debbie and will be given a provided with a separate certificate are in addition to the course participation certificate a second question was are all the participants in the arcy are from different a domains can the interac of course a we encourage all different a participants to interact regardless of domain that is a very good thing but what you have to do is you will have to find a topic which your peers can also evaluate now to facilitate this we have identified sixteen hours on fourteen different domains under which all the participants are coming in you will have to identify which domain topic you are going to create the moodle course fore and that a bill be a battle that will help us also in identifying appropriate groups and letting you do peer evaluation in a group are your first question what is the need of creating moodle course again in this particular course see in the first a in the first course you were exposed only basic doodle a activities like were you uploaded a video you set up quiz activity is you set up a discussion forums etc but that alone is not sufficient for a learning to happen effectively now this is what we call an information transfer approach for being student centric there are other tools in google that you need to use so for example glossary a database peer review or you could use a there are other plugins which encourage grouping and other sort of activities so all these need to be a utilized by you are to ensure that facilitation is proper throughout this course so we will tell you about different active learning strategies also so you can embed these active learning strategies in your raw moodle as well so for example think pair share is a very popular active learning strategy you could do that in moodle using multiple tools or you could do a several other group discussions prosand cons analysis using the moodle tool but how to do this that is what this course is about not specifically in terms of how to do this in moodle but how to do this generally and are the lab activities are meant for you to actually understand these different activities in the model more clearly and i use these to create an effective art teaching learning resource and this resource once you have created this this needs to be evaluated again so it is this repeated practice that will help you in mastering the technology and mastering the facilitation process a am i clear map yes thank you sir are se one four two four a cebu institute of technology so we ask a question making bridges update the details about the words project report activities that perform okay elaboration of course project reporting course project report that the format in which the report so ah this is a question regarding the final we are report now everyone kno any reporting requires a particular format like introduction so every beta project also if you are youre a student would be putting up different chapters different sections you will be looking at various aspects of it how do you create what all assumptions you have made so that a similar format us therefore be we are put as well a example report will be shared with you in the upcoming week that is week three so that you can understand how an open educational resource a has been created in moodle and how it has been a its creation and its evaluation has been reported in that project project report so you will get more details about the wire put a in week three so the iiba makes in the yakima makes will be uploading this example report a product of the time being you can think of it as a five chapter report each chapter focusing on some aspects of the wire first would be an introduction second would be are the details about how the design was done third will be actual creation of the resource in moodle what all did you do it for creating that resource fourth one will be focusing on evaluation and fifth one will be about how can you build on top of it or future work on that particular a move a open education resources archive one three two eight hour i ity technical campus rupa helen allow him with money yes some things i city wedding such a good platform reproduce so my question is which design and engineering knowledge and information on impressions we have pity students and we have the cubiculum vigilance should show deletion advance machine system is a total weeks like that is it possible that all things but we are going to do like with music in years the sleepy skilled hits during all this musician and an evident this food before slippy chickens would use them but how do we need we can impart oak ah so the question is regarding how do you cover syllabus how do you cover curriculum are what i would want you to do is in the next breakout session when you are interacting with horses i would want you to ask the same question to the other horses as well so that you can get different views in which are different ways in which are scenes have actually a trite different people in different artists have tried to do this now ah they are going to be mentors are going to be allotted to this are all the epdp participants you could ask your mentors also as to how and in what way they are utilizing this to cover curriculum are on a general note what i would say yes if you understand the affordance of the technology or understand for what purpose this technology can be used effectively then that would leverage a major part of your raw instructional activity and technology can be used to do that now if you ask me if his technology a single solution for this no unfortunately we do not have any silver bullets to solve the larger issue up again the focus what a word i would ask you again to re examiners do you want to cover the entire curriculum without giving strong conceptual knowledge your learners or do you want to impart the basic are the foundation knowledge a create a good foundation for your students so that they can te and ensure that there will be able to take it or explore and the round there will be able to do critical thinking and the other higher order thinking activities within any course that is there in the curriculum are without worrying about a syllabus coverage or curriculum coverage so this is a question for you to reflect on our answers would vary from person to person but yeah so if you ask me can technology be used yes and no no no in the sense that technology is not a single solution you need a lot of other things to work along with it yes in the sense that technology provides you various affordances if leveraged correctly can help you in increasing the efficiency of your posts this drink is a one three eight seven a lucky radley college andhra pradesh we okay ah okay so this seems to a question that has been asked us what is flipped classroom and a are there any step by step procedure for doing flip classroom cyn flicked classroom essentially means a reversing the standard traditional format of lecture inside the class assignments outside the class of this is one won a one answer to it essentially what you are a bot is meant in flip class rumours you outsource the activity of information transmission to outside the classroom as most of the a students nowadays have access to information and you focus more on knowledge assimilation or you make them do activities inside the classroom so that they comped a have good as they assimilate the content whatever is required well inside the classroom get feedback from peers as well as teachers inside the class now this is a flipped classroom what it is all about the step by step procedure decide what you what all resources you i want your students to access provide instructions on how to access it to students third thing engage students in activities inside the classroom are to go deep into the content and fourth one evaluate and provide rapid feedback to the students are inside the classroom itself so that they will get benefit of all the exercise is yes please wait oh yeah oh oh oh oh yes so we are do understand the question as okay one correction i not seeing that video lectures or as to be given outside the classroom what i am giving are telling you is do the information transmission aspect of it outside the classroom how video is one way of doing this and other ways you prepare the notes in advance and give it to them outside the classroom so that so when theyre travelling lecture there travelling in the bus and coming to college they could actually read through these books or the resources are in an appropriate format and come inside the classroom to actually discuss more on it so for example let us say or you are teaching them some foundational concepts are so i am much more familiar with the either electrical engineering or computer science related subjects shall take the case of a electrical engineering so there is in the first year we have what is not a job a basics about electrical engineering so we have about home slow or workshop then you also have electrical network analysis now what others are standard thing which is known as a problem on a nortons or earnings theorem where a students are given a network they have to solve it and they are the standard procedures that you have to follow or to solve a particular electrical network now what we are actually asking you to do is give these snippets of information about what is nortons theorem waters thevenins theorem are some example problems that day you have worked out outside the classroom it could be either in a video format or it could be done through your own handwritten notes step one step two etc what your actually doing as making them do this information transmission outside the classroom now that is why it is important that i said whatever information transmission or whatever technology you use it has to fit to the local context how context varies across regions now whatever seems fit in a particular context you should use that account i am not seeing that video lectures is so flipped classroom is not about video lectures if you actually listen learn to process neither ious talk are the slides are the videos resources provided by strict process within a year he would be a clearly stating that it is the focus is on information transmission to outside the class so the very fact that we are discussing this we are asking these questions and getting you are getting immediate feedback inside the classroom is actually the one instance of a flipped classroom strategy so you have seen all these resources outside the classroom you have a doubt you come to this review session where you have your peers sitting along with you will be discussing this together and then youll be asking me a question and i give your feedback right now its now this is a perfect scenario of flip clasp so here we are not worried about what the technology is how do you upload videos that is not the op a important aspect that we are focusing on what we are focusing on is on e knowledge assimilation so your misconceptions about flea classroom understanding your misconceptions about flick classroom clarifying them getting you better feedback getting you feedback from your peers as well that is what you should focus inside the classroom so the theory definition and the other basic things you can still outsource to your students and you know that as student if your good luna i mean as a learner it does not bar you from armidale be more inquisitive to understand and work with the content rather than just listen in the classroom and passively listen to the lecture or do some routine activities you should avoid doing that inside the classroom rather make them do lot of activities inside the classroom through which deal be more engaged a deal a deal actually critically go through the content they will understand the fundamental or the foundational aspect of the concepts that you want to teach them yeah okay so the question is about why this is kept on saturday and sunday are up are you a recent or see a remote center a horsey won three in seven year so if you look at the scale at which we are running this program so we have close two hundred and three are remote centers who are connected to the scores and for a faculty from all these places attending this course are other than a saturday and sunday you will not get all of them together in at dusk for the same session now if we schedule it on a monday or tuesday they would be activities in some colleges that would actually a will not allow these faculty to participate in sessions on saturday and sunday azeri in on monday and tuesday so there may be lectures for which they have to go in between there could be other engagements that are the have to do a during those two days which will not allow you to completely engage in these sessions and that is why saturday and sunday are chosen and if you actually look at the total duration of the courts which is actually two months we are asking you to come only for six days so out of sixty days we are asking you to come only for six days i dont think that is something a large we are asking you a we are providing you with the resources online every week we released the content with the due dates and although things so we are making use of both the facilities are making the best use of both synchronicity an asynchronous okay asynchronously you are accessing the itee bombays page within your own flexible time period and when you are in the lab so for example when you are in the artsy today today afternoon will be entirely devoted to do activity and tomorrow you will be interacting with your other horses now this particular aspect you will not get if you are coming on a monday or or any weekday okay let me now move on to the next are sea or sea are one three five three one four five three along with money so my question is as you said we are activity should be done it so can there be more than three particular where i okay the question is regarding that a maximum number of members in we are group a be would limit it to three in exceptional circumstances we will arm allow four people but not more than food but again it is subject to why a four us we need to have a see that there are no others there are no other to get this person will be left out so the reasons like these so these are the exceptional circumstances and it is on a case by case basis that we will actually approve that particular team so ideally three because then each of these activities each one can involve themselves completely in because we offer mechanical domain people so we are planning to book them together so in those kind of circumstances we do allow a lessee within an hour he asks why dont you split yourself into two groups of two which is indeed a better solution if ya would ya so if you have four people it is easier for you right there is two people in one group two people in another group i can be a good way but we are planning put together can we do that are so in this case i would specifically recommend you to form two groups because you need a all fee it is not about forming the group you need to get practice with the activity of both courts creation and model and also on how do you report a such kind of we are so this activity if you have not experienced you will lose out on the critical aspect of the safety that is why we want two to three members per team acacia theatre we are will be of two candidate right yes yes our group or group were groovin where yes okay next question from a peer hello hello they are by my question is that what is the main objective of creating a course in a group so what do you want faculties to a too when they create a group course because many time faculties are teaching individually the full course is taught so what is the purpose of creating group creating a group so ah let me come back to the group activities are once again the rationale of this group activity say in the group activity you will be exploring model in more detail so will be asking you to go beyond just uploading a video resource just uploading desk creating discussion forums we would want you to create more activities in the model and also create a report of how you selected these particular activities and up for your own topic now doing this individually will take a lot of time and you have only a week approximately a week to complete the creation of the course and you will get approximately a week to write the report how to do this individually it is going to take a lot of time and when youre doing this in a group you could actually do what you say or distribute the tasks within the group and also focus on completion of re creating a good course material a which other users can also take part okay thank you on the western style okay so there is another question on are zero one ill be addressing it shortly but let me now look into some of the other questions in the question stab op together was a question for maasai one for one won were a participant was in a different domains i gave the answer or if you are in a different domain will be uploading a team where you can find people from the same domain and create o your teams or go down out of okay so there is a question regarding seo annum imus were poor i saw the question right now it is regarding two participants who had two a reach or see one two nine to a workshop team up are the coordinater details available for arcy one two nine to a can you kindly share this with artsy one one zero three okay the coordinator of archive and museum you will get the information water categories which are checked under plagiarism if or excel file and peppy file okay this is important or categories of files you will be uploading your final we are a activity in a pedia format and will accept only media format for the final report and so all the files will be in pda format yeah lets go back to the centers are this arcy one zero six three device patil a pune are you not audible can you check your my cannot audible a knockout trouble at all okay ah or three one zero six three bill either combat you are in the meanwhile can you post your question in the question staff so that we can take it up from there and answered okay lets move to the next a horsey horsey one four two six integral university puno up a lucknow alu alu can you keep the mike a bit closer i am not able to hear your question yes sir my admins yes this guy is this a fd be equivalent to ority orientation program or refresher course okay equivalents of the said debbie i think it would be equivalent to an orientation course orientation or refresher one hour but it will be a both a if dtype oneplus dippy too if you do it or what is the typical duration demanded for an orientation or a refresher course the thirty days also unfortunately this is equivalent only fourteen days so youll have to find some more raw activities at your center which could add on to the remaining arm a duration of the orientation or refresher course required the second question is can a person create we are individually no ah so thats what im saying repeatedly if you do not find a person in the a particular domain a beilby opening up a discussion forum of which has sahib which has a which has people divided into domains you can select the domain and then arm or interact or re create a group with them okay so our next question is so if youre a uploading any of the pea a pediphile powerpoint presentation file to her pleasure juice chicken that i am okay a plagiarism check you will have to utilize sore so a any format of file but waters to check for plagiarism youll have to use appropriate are softwares four roar a plagiarism check up one example software is turnitin which actually checks for plagiarism org there are other software as well so youll have to utilize these kind of far utilities to do the plagiarism check there but the basis a i want to know the boat is the basis of thinking because in word its usually high consecutive words seven consecutive words if it is found in same sequence it is being under pressure to what are the basis of pretty high so you will not be uploading any pity file as part of a plagiarism check in any format it is actually looking up on the similarity of the content or in two files so if you use these software staunton or other software it actually has a repository or it will check in the web for similarity of the information and it will indicate how much of this is similar for the purpose of this particular ebc we will be accepting only pedia files are and not any puppets so one more question cant we try a inter disciplinary for creating we are absolutely you are welcome to create interdisciplinary topics but what you also have to ensure is that whatever topic you choose there are people to evaluate so creation of voyeur is not the problem the problem is in evaluation of new york so you whatever interdisciplinary topic you take an oh yeah you should find us a capable person to do peer review for the two year if you do not find it or if the a resource person is not familiar with that particular topic how will they be able to evaluate your yard so that is why we have we have identified fourteen domains and we are asking you to create resources in these fourteen domains so that youll be able to identify a a what is a suitable peer evaluator for your ra oh yeah yeah okay arcy one one three one wall sconce with morning sun with money this is with respect to the contents of flipped classroom which are the contents secondly we have deliberately understood how muslim has to be conducted there how men and now at present we are in a scenario where we have an open ended admissions morden engineering colleges in so many engineering colleges and the number of students are listening to this situation learning can only happen if we adopt methods like simulated annealing a reinforcement which will bring the student to be really heated and hammered in terms of learning and then the concept goes into the mind bes particular students know and we have a method which probably we have used without using icity a method call dents teaching by example a wherein i take a pre test which is a one minute test to see what the prerequisites the student knows then i each them without giving an example then i get the results of the test by having another one minute test then i pitched them the same concept giving an example and then i get the results again by one minute tests and by this particular experiment i found that learning has happened in a better big i have one suggestion here that since itey bombay hall ways lying and planning to have new things and innovative things can be used this particular practice in your flip classroom such that videos are created by teaching a concept without giving an example followed by a video which is created by giving an example in it and then learning at the end of a particular session is going to be understood what this i feel that what we are aiming at developing foundation and conceptual knowledge to be imparted in students may definitely be i would like to have your suggestions regarding this particular aspect yeah so its a first of all its an interesting suggestion so what are from archive on one tree one what has been suggested as can we teach using examples and he has followed a systematic procedure through which he has ensured effectiveness of this particular method and what i want all our seas to take from this is how you can do systematic evaluation of your own practice so a good works or what your doing is actually very op what is there a systematic process of actually evaluating your own practice i was reflecting on it and improving the content job a kudos to you yes the method can definitely be useful are now the limitations of this again and so it actually as you said reinforcement of learning another important thing is the moment you give at a real life example or use some examples for teaching a concept what youre actually transferring us learning based on a context which has been found to be very effective across different settings are okay so it could be used for a venue hab so ideally this is suitable when you have a similar demography of pa loners or burn learners are required similar prerequisite and they are learning a one type of content the moment diversity concerned are you will have to cater to the diverse audience of for example a take the case of a bear we have a fierce teachers we have mechanical teachers we have science teachers we have teachers from multiple domains a challenge over here is that how can you create example such that a common example such that all the people will understand from the same example now or if you run a teacher professional development course for a particular domain then this would have been a method that we would have also used where we bring in the example and we teach by that example in a diverse setting there are certain limitations of using it but still you can provide additional resources give different different examples through which this could be a a protein and one way in which we are trying to bring in these examples are the user created examples for each of these activities now in the past if dtype you were exposed to multiple teachers creating content in different domains there the topic of discussion was a particular technology like say a moodle moodle was the topic but they could use their own examples to create their own content each teacher was exposed to different ways in which other teachers have used mood now this is one way in which we are trying to incorporate this but yeah we cannot have one minute tests or in between because this is an online setting but we are trying our level best to ensure that most people get the content that is required and the learned from each other i nourish handy hence my question to you is regarding application we are and will in large heterogeneous we up lie we are and other goods nor shall it be okay we are in a precise okay so are two answer your question are we are having a large and heterogeneous class a inity bombacks sveum close to two thousand three hundred participants in debbie to we had close to three thousand three hundred participants in occupy what how all the resources that be created in if dtype wand or open educational resources so you could see that it is applicable to all people if you design your instruction you align your instruction strategy according to the content and do the assessment also aligned to the objectives of the that you have decided for the course so it is applicable any technology for that matter is applicable as long as you identify the affordances of the technology and use that technology for that purpose learning purpose okay okay so my next question is regarding peer review peer review and resource creation actually i had created a resource creation activity and i was uploaded it on the moodle course and it was reviewed also but it was the sum of the points were not considered a little at what was the reason i would like to know okay so this is a general question regarding peer review so they have had grievances are across all of the peso for all of the page we have seen that air review is a problematic a thing because she first thing is that you need to be familiar with this process to understand what peer review ways how do you give feedback or how do you rate something how do you do subjective evaluation and this ftp is a process through which we are training you to do peer review first yourself so that you can do this effectively four your spuds now ah many a times it may happen that some of the peer reviews or you may not agree with and they would not have elaborated why they have given a particular feedback oh this is a place where we as an individual should understand limitations of doing things at school now if your rapier is not familiar with this process then it is a it will be what is a frustrating for you but take this as a learning experience take this as a learning experience in the sense that if you do this in your classroom and if your learners are not getting sufficient feedback what all additional mechanisms should you take it to give appropriate feedback to the original a student who created this resource now in the last left deepy what beef doneness ah we have collected all the grievances regarding peer review and we are now in the process through our raw corsi more here to evaluate each of your feedback based on the criteria that we have said so the course team will now do one level of a review on top of whatever a a the your peers have done for those people who have submitted a grievance in the end of course feedback sir now we will be doing that since it is the number of receive a resources we have is limited and the number of grievances are more it will take us nearly twenty to twenty five days to complete will be doing that across this month and this by this month and will be updating your score based on the pier view that we have done at our accepted it and i am happy with it and just want to ask the deadline was given yearly attainable admitted at nine o clock mentality around too it wasnt and that would make one a e far if you have so a are you sure that your submitted aid a clicked on the submit button you can ahead also arm i in the sense that is the new did not get peer review or it was not considered offer peer review at all if it wasnt considered to be fairly okay so it may happen will over here there are two issues one is that you have submitted and if your fear i have not evaluated at it maybe that it may be still be lying with your peers so you also have to understand that there are people who may not have actually done the peer review aspect of it so it is not so one aspect is so technology wise if your submitted obviously your pia will get it and it is up to the pier to comply but the process and give you feedback acism yeah ah yeah i am new to us or see one activity in week two baby beethoven we are supposed to explain the icy tomb which were used with the evidences to what exactly were the evidences are expected and so far all are says are there seems to be a common query regarding are zero and activity what hell do is in the next session i take an example are zero one submission adult show you what is expected from each of you when you answer that particular activity okay so are in the next session which starts at eleven thirty al explicitly take are se are a horse a zero one assignment ill show you an example and ill show you what needs to be written what all aspects needs to be ill a brought out and how it needs to be evaluated okay thank you ah i go for one more or see for the time being a wheel when we come back what we are going to do is wield a please post all the questions in the question stapp soil use the questions start to answer all your questions but when we comeback will explicitly address are zero and queries and i also give you the topics for which you have to do activity today aftern okay the groups and daddy activities now i am going to ask one four zero to vardaman college andhra allow allow uncertain a coming to her this week to assignment it is mention that we have to go for this class are actually in the summer vacation is going on and along the classwork is not then how we can engage with the designer now okay so are you talking of resource creation assignment one or are you talking of lab assignments and speaking about lab or seminars even archive and so are se one is not about a what you have what you want to do right now so youd have learnt some technology for technologies in the last one month of the igf depae right yes you may have used some of these inside your classrooms okay or you might have used some technology inside your classroom before the afc also yes sir yes sir we have used okay so the are save one is about what changes did you see when you use technology inside the classroom okay and some of the things that you have observed when you bring in technology to the classroom the assignment is about it for you to articulate what changes are you seeing in your classroom when using technology that said it maybe during the afc it it does not mean that you have to use the same technology is inside the classroom it is all about how use of technology has resulted in few changes it may be very minor change that your scene but how do you acknowledge that change how do you understand that change oh okay ill be explaining this in detail here at eleven thirty when we reassemble vacation okay so now we are going for a going for a break a wheel restart the session at eleven thirty at eleven thirty when me come back the ribby one a explanation of archi zero one a second thing explanation of lab activity that you have to do are today afternoon or together within the or sea and also details about the breakout activity that we are going to do tomorrow okay yeah i can get that last year we have tried flick classroom but students are not accessing out of class resources and do not come with the cum inside the classroom with the appropriate readings are this is a common a a query about a flipped classroom that students do not boo the required activities see the basic way in which a you have two encouraged you will have to give some incentives will have to encourage students in doing these out of class activity and you should make them understand why doing this out of class activities imported and the sea specifically a most students are exam a deal be worried only about the exams that they do or about the placements that they get now it is important that you need to encourage you need to put give activities inside the classroom that will either help them in are getting are some vintage either at the placement level or in the exam now many of the universitys the assessment system will be mostly about recall to apply level a questions and you may not actually test higher order abilities of the student and whereas in a real job situation it is the higher order ability that gives more weight which what you have to one way of in which you could encourage students is to by saying that will be doing these higher order activities which will be actually useful for them in any job setting the kind of processes that you do inside a classroom about thinking about a solution we are doing discussions with your group combinedly doing activities it is all the more relevant in a job like situation and that is what our engineering and science is all about or any of the professional courses all about so if you slowly encourage them make them understand the significance of these activities that is one way in which you can encourage students to do the out of class activities and come a second thing you should do a lot more active learning strategies and it is not easy you will have student resistance initially but we have had a scenarios or best practices were a teachers have persisted with these active learning strategies and have seen results in terms of student engagement particularly i remember a case where a teacher from tamil nadu a a normal engineering college in tamil nadu telling us that she had done all these activities are inside the classroom for almost continued doing active learning activities a weekly in a once a week across a semester and by the end of the semester she was able to involve the backbenchers the students in the back bench in the classroom activity and she had seen visible difference in their exam output so in men it may not be that they have scored ninety per cent or not they may have improved only from thirty per cent to sixty percent but that improvement its like double or what is a significant improvement for that particular a learner group and the across the various workshops across the various safety peace we have heard teachers repeating these instances are again and again so one thing that is more important
