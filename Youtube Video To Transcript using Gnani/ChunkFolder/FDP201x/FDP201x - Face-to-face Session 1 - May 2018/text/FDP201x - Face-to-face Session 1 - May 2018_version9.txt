the two first okay so your question as bill grade be displayed in the certificate no author will not be any greed in the certificate per say but what we are doing us we are at the top performers of people who score above ninety five percent each up in both of these combined will be acknowledged as top performers of this if debbie and will be given a provided with a separate certificate are in addition to the course participation certificate a second question was are all the participants in the arcy are from different a domains can the interac of course a we encourage all different a participants to interact regardless of domain that is a very good thing but what you have to do is you will have to find a topic which your peers can also evaluate now to facilitate this we have identified sixteen hours on fourteen different domains under which all the participants are coming in you will have to identify which domain topic you are going to create the moodle course fore and that a bill be a battle that will help us also in identifying appropriate groups and letting you do peer evaluation in a group are your first question what is the need of creating moodle course again in this particular course see in the first a in the first course you were exposed only basic doodle a activities like were you uploaded a video you set up quiz activity is you set up a discussion forums etc but that alone is not sufficient for a learning to happen effectively now this is what we call an information transfer approach for being student centric there are other tools in google that you need to use so for example glossary a database peer review or you could use a there are other plugins which encourage grouping and other sort of activities so all these need to be a utilized by you are to ensure that facilitation is proper throughout this course so we will tell you about different active learning strategies also so you can embed these active learning strategies in your raw moodle as well so for example think pair share is a very popular active learning strategy you could do that in moodle using multiple tools or you could do a several other group discussions prosand cons analysis using the moodle tool but how to do this that is what this course is about not specifically in terms of how to do this in moodle but how to do this generally and are the lab activities are meant for you to actually understand these different activities in the model more clearly and i use these to create an effective art teaching learning resource and this resource once you have created this this needs to be evaluated again so it is this repeated practice that will help you in mastering the technology and mastering the facilitation process a am i clear map yes thank you sir are se one four two four a cebu institute of technology so we ask a question making bridges
