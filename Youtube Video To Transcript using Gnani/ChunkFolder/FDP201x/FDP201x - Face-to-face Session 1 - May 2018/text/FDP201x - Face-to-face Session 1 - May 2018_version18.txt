i was reflecting on it and improving the content job a kudos to you yes the method can definitely be useful are now the limitations of this again and so it actually as you said reinforcement of learning another important thing is the moment you give at a real life example or use some examples for teaching a concept what youre actually transferring us learning based on a context which has been found to be very effective across different settings are okay so it could be used for a venue hab so ideally this is suitable when you have a similar demography of pa loners or burn learners are required similar prerequisite and they are learning a one type of content the moment diversity concerned are you will have to cater to the diverse audience of for example a take the case of a bear we have a fierce teachers we have mechanical teachers we have science teachers we have teachers from multiple domains a challenge over here is that how can you create example such that a common example such that all the people will understand from the same example now or if you run a teacher professional development course for a particular domain then this would have been a method that we would have also used where we bring in the example and we teach by that example in a diverse setting there are certain limitations of using it but still you can provide additional resources give different different examples through which this could be a a protein and one way in which we are trying to bring in these examples are the user created examples for each of these activities now in the past if dtype you were exposed to multiple teachers creating content in different domains there the topic of discussion was a particular technology like say a moodle moodle was the topic but they could use their own examples to create their own content each teacher was exposed to different ways in which other teachers have used mood now this is one way in which we are trying to incorporate this but yeah we cannot have one minute tests or in between because this is an online setting but we are trying our level best to ensure that most people get the content that is required and the learned from each other i nourish handy hence my question to you is regarding application we are and will in large heterogeneous we up lie we are and other goods nor shall it be okay we are in a precise okay so are two answer your question are we are having a large and heterogeneous class a inity bombacks sveum close to two thousand three hundred participants in debbie to we had close to three thousand three hundred participants in occupy what how all the resources that be created in if dtype wand or open educational resources so you could see that it is applicable to all people if you design your instruction you align your instruction strategy according to the content and do the assessment also aligned to the objectives of the that you have decided for the course so it is applicable any technology for that matter is applicable as long as you identify the affordances of the technology and use that technology for that purpose learning purpose
