okay okay so my next question is regarding peer review peer review and resource creation actually i had created a resource creation activity and i was uploaded it on the moodle course and it was reviewed also but it was the sum of the points were not considered a little at what was the reason i would like to know okay so this is a general question regarding peer review so they have had grievances are across all of the peso for all of the page we have seen that air review is a problematic a thing because she first thing is that you need to be familiar with this process to understand what peer review ways how do you give feedback or how do you rate something how do you do subjective evaluation and this ftp is a process through which we are training you to do peer review first yourself so that you can do this effectively four your spuds now ah many a times it may happen that some of the peer reviews or you may not agree with and they would not have elaborated why they have given a particular feedback oh this is a place where we as an individual should understand limitations of doing things at school now if your rapier is not familiar with this process then it is a it will be what is a frustrating for you but take this as a learning experience take this as a learning experience in the sense that if you do this in your classroom and if your learners are not getting sufficient feedback what all additional mechanisms should you take it to give appropriate feedback to the original a student who created this resource now in the last left deepy what beef doneness ah we have collected all the grievances regarding peer review and we are now in the process through our raw corsi more here to evaluate each of your feedback based on the criteria that we have said so the course team will now do one level of a review on top of whatever a a the your peers have done for those people who have submitted a grievance in the end of course feedback sir now we will be doing that since it is the number of receive a resources we have is limited and the number of grievances are more it will take us nearly twenty to twenty five days to complete will be doing that across this month and this by this month and will be updating your score based on the pier view that we have done at our accepted it and i am happy with it and just want to ask the deadline was given yearly attainable admitted at nine o clock mentality around too it wasnt and that would make one a e far if you have so a are you sure that your submitted aid a clicked on the submit button you can ahead also arm i in the sense that is the new did not get peer review or it was not considered offer peer review at all if it wasnt considered to be fairly okay so it may happen will over here there are two issues one is that you have submitted and if your fear i have not evaluated at it maybe that it may be still be lying with your peers so you also have to understand that there are people who may not have actually done the peer review aspect of it so it is not so one aspect is so technology wise if your submitted obviously your pia will get it and it is up to the pier to comply
