i want your students to access provide instructions on how to access it to students third thing engage students in activities inside the classroom are to go deep into the content and fourth one evaluate and provide rapid feedback to the students are inside the classroom itself so that they will get benefit of all the exercise is yes please wait oh yeah oh oh oh oh yes so we are do understand the question as okay one correction i not seeing that video lectures or as to be given outside the classroom what i am giving are telling you is do the information transmission aspect of it outside the classroom how video is one way of doing this and other ways you prepare the notes in advance and give it to them outside the classroom so that so when theyre travelling lecture there travelling in the bus and coming to college they could actually read through these books or the resources are in an appropriate format and come inside the classroom to actually discuss more on it so for example let us say or you are teaching them some foundational concepts are so i am much more familiar with the either electrical engineering or computer science related subjects shall take the case of a electrical engineering so there is in the first year we have what is not a job a basics about electrical engineering so we have about home slow or workshop then you also have electrical network analysis now what others are standard thing which is known as a problem on a nortons or earnings theorem where a students are given a network they have to solve it and they are the standard procedures that you have to follow or to solve a particular electrical network now what we are actually asking you to do is give these snippets of information about what is nortons theorem waters thevenins theorem are some example problems that day you have worked out outside the classroom it could be either in a video format or it could be done through your own handwritten notes step one step two etc what your actually doing as making them do this information transmission outside the classroom now that is why it is important that i said whatever information transmission or whatever technology you use it has to fit to the local context how context varies across regions now whatever seems fit in a particular context you should use that account i am not seeing that video lectures is so flipped classroom is not about video lectures if you actually listen
