a second thing explanation of lab activity that you have to do are today afternoon or together within the or sea and also details about the breakout activity that we are going to do tomorrow okay yeah i can get that last year we have tried flick classroom but students are not accessing out of class resources and do not come with the cum inside the classroom with the appropriate readings are this is a common a a query about a flipped classroom that students do not boo the required activities see the basic way in which a you have two encouraged you will have to give some incentives will have to encourage students in doing these out of class activity and you should make them understand why doing this out of class activities imported and the sea specifically a most students are exam a deal be worried only about the exams that they do or about the placements that they get now it is important that you need to encourage you need to put give activities inside the classroom that will either help them in are getting are some vintage either at the placement level or in the exam now many of the universitys the assessment system will be mostly about recall to apply level a questions and you may not actually test higher order abilities of the student and whereas in a real job situation it is the higher order ability that gives more weight which what you have to one way of in which you could encourage students is to by saying that will be doing these higher order activities which will be actually useful for them in any job setting the kind of processes that you do inside a classroom about thinking about a solution we are doing discussions with your group combinedly doing activities it is all the more relevant in a job like situation and that is what our engineering and science is all about or any of the professional courses all about so if you slowly encourage them make them understand the significance of these activities that is one way in which you can encourage students to do the out of class activities and come a second thing you should do a lot more active learning strategies and it is not easy you will have student resistance initially but we have had a scenarios or best practices were a teachers have persisted with these active learning strategies and have seen results in terms of student engagement particularly i remember a case where a teacher from tamil nadu a a normal engineering college in tamil nadu telling us that she had done all these activities are inside the classroom for almost continued doing active learning activities a weekly in a once a week across a semester and by the end of the semester she was able to involve the backbenchers the students in the back bench in the classroom activity and she had seen visible difference in their exam output so in men it may not be that they have scored ninety per cent or not they may have improved only from thirty per cent to sixty percent but that improvement its like double or what is a significant improvement for that particular a learner group and the across the various workshops across the various safety peace we have heard teachers repeating these instances are again and again so one thing that is more important
