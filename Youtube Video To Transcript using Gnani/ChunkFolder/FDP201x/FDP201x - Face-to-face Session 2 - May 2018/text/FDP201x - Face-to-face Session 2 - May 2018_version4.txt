but in twenty years time when the youngest children in the world we start adapting to internet technology who knows after twenty years they may scoff at reading texts they might peru some text which is in the digital form but they would prefer the knowledge bites in terms of sound in terms of visuals it of course aided by the written cant consequently we must understand at the open educational resource that we create must be in a multi media form second it is our responsibility to create such content not only because it is parked when exercise without completing which you will not get a certificate from this workshop it is barely a mechanism to help you understand how best to create a toy but you must additionally and continuously create such small digital assets for the benefit of your students whenever you teach a course i would like you to take a bow your what i told about three thousand teachers i want each one of you to make a commitment to yourself the commitment made to me commitment between each one commitment is simp whenever you teach a course in future next semester starting from julie subsequent semesters in every course in every course you will create at least two open educational resources they could be just a webpage right up there could be just a two minute video clip there could be an audio tutorial you decide what you want but you create that and release it under let me tell you it will be a great service not only to your students but to the entire london learning community of the country and of the world in fact so please dont limit the creation of ohio to be an activity of this workshop hello i know you will all do it because as i said you will get a nice city approved certificate we just some brownie points and lag but more important than that like all good things we learn we learn them to practice into use so i would like you to make a commitment to yourself that each one of you no matter which course to teach every semester a course which will teach you will create and contribute at least a couple of open educational resources for the benefit of your students and for the benefit of all i will mention one more point about who you are and then i will go to the concluding point and that point is about the ability of people to search easily a useful content that has been created by i think had stated this earlier and the last i city workshop pepe loaded puzzle that when you search the web by any google or any other search engine you will get one lag answers all of us invariably look only at the first page and whatever is displayed the first page of the search results we tend to think that theyre the maximally useful that is not to take wikipedia wikipedia permits you to do a better search by defining multiple phrases or multiple keywords so that you can pin point not hundreds but two three five meaningful articles how is that possible that is possible because whenever somebody creates an article in wikipedia they would create these tag words and these tag words will permit search engines to specifically drill down to the most relevant please note therefore that when you create an we are counted lets you create a video clip a five minutes and it explores lets say i am a mathematics professor and i want to teach some very basic things to mice
