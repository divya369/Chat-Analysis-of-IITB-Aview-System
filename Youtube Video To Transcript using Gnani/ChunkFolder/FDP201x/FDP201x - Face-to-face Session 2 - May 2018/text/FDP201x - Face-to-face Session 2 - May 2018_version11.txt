i want to be beneficial for them or some important class actions in the classroom that show evidence of student engagement or student loan so this is what is meant by student feedback so but the most important thing about this answer is your own reflection so in terms of reflection on usage what the teacher has said it does i see that i city has increased access and efficiency of teaching learning process in my class hour i do see the following drawbacks as an instructor i need to spend more time with use of social media we have to be extra careful about data privacy students seem to be more including social media gratification and do not focus on actual learning behind the activity i will have to now focus on ensuring that students do not go by instant fame rather rely on deep load now this are words of teacher who have done something with the technology and is learning from the entire experience and this is what we mean by reflection on usage do not worry if you have already submitted the answer that is always se we all learn from different diverse views so this is one example view that we have shown over here they could be different other ways in which several teachers write the answer but what is important is that what is important is that you focus on these three aspects while writing your answer it is like a short essay where you need to articulate your thoughts you have you some technology inside the classroom what was your experience it may be good or bad but what changes did you see it may be positive it may be negative but it is what is important is are you reflecting on this positive and negative experiences and trying to do something more that is what we intend from this particular exercise so ah the example submission is available in the iety bombays a course itself now we have added below the rubric so description of the rubric a if you have any queries are on the are zero one please post them as a questions in the tab or if somebody has already posted a question similar to yours please upvote it so that we can address it from the a a view a tab ill be explaining that towards the end of this interaction helps take time to look at the question and answer your answer the that particular quest now what is important is the aview interactions that your going to do today and tomorrow today as you all know you will do a local activity and to morrow what your going to do is you do a breakout session where you will continue to do a thus a interact with other horses and get reflection and feedback on the activities that you have planned local so up the lab and breakout activities the scenario is that all of you have gone through the basics of good but muddle we you have usually few elements as of now
