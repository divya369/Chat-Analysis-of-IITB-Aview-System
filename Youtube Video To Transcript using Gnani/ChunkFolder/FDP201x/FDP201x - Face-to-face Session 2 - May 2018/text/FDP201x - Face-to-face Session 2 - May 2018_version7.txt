and the like but are hardly discussed extensively while theyre studying in the colleges we have found over the years all almost all the corporate friends tell me sir your stools are brilliant again wake later draftnik obla their contracts they cant write proper email they dont have behavioral knowledge of simple cut sees this headpiece does there are many such courses just started but ighty bombay has been running these courses for the benefit of students and we want to emphatically run them in the blend modes what it means is that this food is from a college will attend the ave you sessions online but will also have such interactive session what we would like to happen that in each color there at least one teacher who is a coordinator and that coordinator actually warm monitors how these tools are doing guides them supervises them these holders can wish the course and therefore it is quite possible that the institution may not pay attention but my experience tells me differently almost all institutions understand that these courses are at least as important as the conventional educational courses if not more important and therefore many of these colleges on their own have appointed coordinators of their own i remember having gone to a management college in lucknow last year and raven i ask them their large number of students and i ask the web management whether they appointed a coordinator he smiled and said sir you are seeing free of them sitting there and two more were busy elsewhere are not here i said what you mean five coordinator he said sir we have student from five different brunches since they operate in different parts of the building throughout the day we decided when we called for volunteers from each of the disciples and there are five of them and they all enjoyed i think that was an exceptional diligence by that institution i forget the name of that talent now management school but i compliment them and i would like to think that all colleges in the country should use this opportunity to benefit their students by offering a blended book rather than a plain online please remember the advantage of blended move it is not just interaction that the teacher will have the students but the student support i am a student in your college i will feel more responsible and accountable not just in order to give my online exam but there is a teacher called jackie will ask me every week last week cacnea did you do this group assignment and therefore i feel i bore on table and therefore i learn more now i would like majority of you were doing this pedagogy course to offer yourselves to your own college and say that you would be willing to become a coordinate so that the students are helped to learn not just their academic content which are covered by the university syllabus but something which we all believe are important skills that is why we call them scheme you know we run four types of books the ag moves which are educational books are educational courses the teacher moves which are these a web of books like environment that we create workshops in the third is skillbooks where we teach them skills the fourth work which were contemplating and will be creating soon called life what is a life who you know our students and they pass out they become professionals and their work at various levels their life becomes completely occupied by their workforce require but would they not like to retain themselves would they not like to keep themselves abreast with whatever is happening unfortunately most of them do not have time
