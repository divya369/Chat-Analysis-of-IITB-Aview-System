you make them available as a compendium is a reference but additionally pertaining to the subject that you are teaching pertaining to what students are expected to learn including what exams you have to give it is our responsibility as a teacher to give them a very well guided to a very well abridge version we must tell them that look these are two hundred resources which are extremely useful however you must minimally read this article read these chapters read this particular tutorial of this web so give them very specific things which they will actually be able to spend time on and learn best the trick therefore is not only identifying all available open educational resources and make those available to the students but the trick is to give them a guidance that in a specified time period of a semester when they are studying one particular course with you or that course to learn minimally what is required to master the concepts of that particular course if they study these days theirs and theirs then they will be able to master the particular techniques and concepts that i think its a greater responsibility only those of you who have seen the plethora of references that you get or open educational resources with you search you will understand the significance and importance of working through a preparation of such a guided tour that remains our response so that is one aspect of open educational resource that i wanted to stress the other aspect is creating open educational resource hours so let me step back and say forget whether the resources open or not any resource that helps learning which created by teachers traditionally how did we create such a resource well we wrote notes psycho style the xerox them and circulated or we wrote explanatory points examples and so on essentially are we wrote books some of us have written books essentially the way teachers contributed maximally to the knowledge content was by writing so text writing printing cyclo styling xeroxing was the only mechanism for us to create meaningful please note that the modern technology permits us to create content in completely different form which is multimedia i can create a video clip i can create merely a sound you might have heard of the spoken tutorials project which proceed kernan mughal a runs all the spoken to dresser techniques tutorials they are of course some slides but mostly it is spoken words in the old times there was no technology which could easily permit people to create such woken or visual material add permit large number of people to access such content very easily it is now possible to do so but do we do that to the diff amongst the billions of teachers who are there in this world majority of them still write text still create using technology did a fine still circulate notes why not just because they believe students find it easier to read them but because they themselves find it easier to create afterall that is what they have done all their lives i think as teachers we must change ourselves so the form of content that we create has changed substantially and will continue to change in the coming years please note
