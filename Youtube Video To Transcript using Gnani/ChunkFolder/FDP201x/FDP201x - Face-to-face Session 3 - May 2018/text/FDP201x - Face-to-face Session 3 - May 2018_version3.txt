all the time but the timing of the classroom is a very specific so now i so like a your a group classrooms were available in the morning but they were they will not be available in the afternoon right now so if you try to join them or join the groups draw now they were their will they or wont be any a person locked in a right now theyre so right now you are a logged in to every week classroom so this is the obdii classroom items that you are available so after you log in first thing you have to do is you have to click on this video but this is the start and stop button of your video though is says video over there this is the start and stop button of your video once you click on this you will get a screen or ill just go from a desktop sharing to a document i would document where i can show you how guys think the document is not available here okay so i hope your tried none of the start button and video button so once you click on that button you ussion interface where you are able to wear where youre able to see hear or see the camera options you have youll be able to see select the camera then select microphone and there is a bandwidth option also there to select so a what most of the people are doing is they think that their bandwidth is okay sudheer selecting five and two and above so what we suggest is whatever your bandwidth is please select two fifty six as your bandwidth when you start the video because a whatever your bandwidth is a few select to fifty sex it will stream seem seamlessly across all the remote centers but if your bandwidth goes down if you select more than five eventful bandwidth i in the s a bandwidth option then if your bandwidth goes down by some reason so some books are some reasons then there might be some problems in the connections or the transmission of the ground so we suggest that every time you a start the video you select with two you start with two fifty six and whips bandwidth keep a standard pci so ah after youve selected your camera then after youve selected your microphone proper microphone when there is a start button once you click the start button i hope youre able to see my desktop right so once you click your start button a video of your own your own live video appears on the righthand side topcon so here right now your saying that my video is available here if your video is not available if the video doesnt start it will show your blank screen that means there is some problem with your capture card or there is some problem with a connection of your camp so once you start your video you should be able to see your own live video on the right hand side topcon so this a assures you that your video is being streamed life after this i just go through this a user list these these four taps this user list chat viewer and question staff so what a this user list is a way where you can see all the users which are connected right right now
