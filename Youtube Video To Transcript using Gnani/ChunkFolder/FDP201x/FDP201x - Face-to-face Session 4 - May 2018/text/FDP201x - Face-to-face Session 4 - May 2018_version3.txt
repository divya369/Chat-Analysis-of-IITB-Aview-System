the in lab activity and breakout sessions yeah yeah ah let me go to ask one four five three allow allow yeah maybe i want to ask you one question regarding the polling feature you mentioned okay so that polling feature is not available right now in our view that is a because we are not a teacher that the reason or yes oh yes there is on some other reason you need to be a teacher arab are to actually get the polling functionality so ah yes eve if i am a teacher then i have a different software or i get a different access from your site so long the server side run from the server side you will get a different privilege which enables lot of different buttons that otherwise is not visible for students working up to add another thing is a recurring teaser today activity also wear this da thinking about the work which we did since yesterday and today yes also yesterday was the task given earth in our group eleven days we were supposed to do the workshop were a feature and we were able to do it yesterday and today morning we also completed our presentation in our group and so he ade it was a time in a sufficient term when there was sufficient time to do and then there was not a time remaining also okay choice you mentioned that a groups nor the different archives can communicate with each other thats the reason that you are keeping this a long time yes but a normally are doing what we understand is that if there is any complex problem then there is a scope of discussion but if we can do it ourselves then a discussion a requires amin a within the group if we can discuss then we may not be able to a need a discussion with the other axis choke a such activities can we deduce a cer these times a year from today to one day and weekend we can do this a this type of work or is it possible or you are you thinking this direction so also the question is can be reduced so the question asked by ars arcy one four five three is that many of these activities seem to be are taking less amount of time so maybe when hard when there is discussion if they are short activities the discussions happen pretty fast and it stops over there again we have lot of time remaining at the archive or something that all horses need to understand is that this is also time that between archives you can interact and you can show a lot more things you can discuss how it is applicable in your settings something that we are encouraging us that use this time to interact with each other and explore so if we say that we authors only one module that you have to ask a discuss it actually the idea is that okay at least ensure that at least one module gets discuss but if there is sufficient time take the time to learn little more about other modules or other things as well ah unfortunately we have been we cannot force all people to engage in exploratory discussions and that has never been done so the original teitan kitty model when it started was that it becomes information today
