i said okay and if there is a mix of hurt if there is a mix of activity will be a groups i think itll be better so the derby and knowledge transfer for other activities like glossary database even reveals also yeah so are so the question posted by r says that if if interaction could have been different that would have help see that is exactly what your going to do next week i will be posting all the moodle courses created by other ares is in the iati bobex page or during in the upcoming week when the activities released for the next week so i would encourage all participants to go through all those activities are these activities have been created with the mindset that you are all teachers and you would like to know what other activities are so you should take this opportunity to first learn from what others have done and also give them feedback as to how that particular course could improve so i completely appreciate the feedback that you are given right now so you should give similar feedback to your ra other arses as to how they could improve a a the moodle a course so that it is more meaningful and you learn a lot more things and why your participants are actually looking through the courses i would also recommend that they are you yourselves look at multiple resources so one set of people look at our resources provided by lets a one or see on glossary one another or see on the arm on wikis etc so that among yourselves also youll see the variation of work done by different darcys year beginning jackie can hear me yes i can give these were only two suggestions year persephone yukos is worki yana attending we are we can gain multiple knowledge on hooky but the suggestion number one is the certificate provided by you will begin bonus novak can yet what we will be helpful to us in any appraisal will be there after leading used kid elderly promotion so can you suggest some of the policies to oasis it would be more valuable to us and goes yeah yeah yeah what is your second suggestion a second bonus uses the discussion forum is on both disagrees in sandys one suggestion is why we have a discussion forum for nobody on sunday because already you hav i debate suggestions queries forum medicine yet so still we have any queries or doubts better will boost the instead of having it for the entire day there is minute second suggestion okay okay let me address the concern regarding certificate so are the certificate that we are issuing i think all horses are many other participants they are submitting these certificates as a valid certificate for faculty development a a which is mandated as per the career advancement scheme also this is a two week equivalent each course is a two week equivalent certificate so you will you can show total of four weeks of faculty development activity and one important thing when you are attending a four week a or a two week course a this one particular day you are getting through these discussions you are getting one day of activity that is the equivalency the course across a week is equal and only to eight hours or for it
