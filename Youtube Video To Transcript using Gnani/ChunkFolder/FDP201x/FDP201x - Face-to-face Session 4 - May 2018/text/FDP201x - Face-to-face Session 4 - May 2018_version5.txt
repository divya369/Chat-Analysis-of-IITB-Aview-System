centered learning and we are using a our current incentives if you actually look at it we are using a the certificates and mandatory attendance both stick and carrot a have to be given to ensure that participation happens and this is the case even in a normal classroom see in normal classroom another problem with discussion forums is that they have war themselves to interact with you they have physical presence so many a times it may so happen that they may not need discussion forum to actually work or discuss the problem but where discussion forum might be more useful i suppose they are doing something in their system and they have to show that to the others that is where discussion forum becomes it becomes an asynchronous activity but that is where it has more power where it has more raw utility where it is tied to a particular activity that they were doing inside the lab at that moment how are you will have to see it it also depends on the context that means or what subject it was what time it was does a students or students very much involved in discussion kind of activity and traditionally a asians specifically indians are indian audience are they do not participate too much in written communication they do more it is more of an oral communication that has been the norm for almost a great amount of time due to which there is also attitudinal or belief based issue in participating in discussion forums but if you look to the west or to the other regions there are more tuned into the discussion based off a interactions and they will be readily participating in the discussion forum are now they also have additional utilities like whatsapp or facebook messenger facebook so that also leaves away the idea of discussion forums tied to a learning platform so if you had conducted the same discussion maybe in facebook the reaction might have been very different also again it really depends upon what works in that context a i appreciate the feedback that were given because yes it is correct or up in the initial it also has to be a habit we also have to understand that only when it becomes a habit will people be tuned to do the discussion now at least every participants know that saturday sunday is gone because i have abu interaction now from their time trying to move them towards oak there is a lab activity on saturday afternoon and other the breakout session which i have to do on sunday morning that we are trying to inculcate the habit slowly and steadily so that teachers also get used to these kind of practices and try to work with us but it is a slow process and we are doing it at a scale which also creates a large problem am even a smaller issue gets compounded big a year but so is the times i completely appreciate the feedback we will definitely try to refine the session because we are also learning a lot from these kind of sessions and i hope you will also be refining your home a practice based on whatever you are learning from eff dippy too as well thank you for the feedback or a wish you well in the courses that you are taking are in the upcoming semester year thank you thank you rip ya let me now go to a r see double one double zero a mrs pillay institute allow
