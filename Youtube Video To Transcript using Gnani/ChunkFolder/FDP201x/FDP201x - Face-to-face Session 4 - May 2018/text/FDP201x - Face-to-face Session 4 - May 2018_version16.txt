why to six hours of a teaching learning material it is not worth more than that so if you want to complete the sow with four weeks you can only online mode you will be able to completely foreign to six twenty four hours which is actually a much four days four days worth interaction or four days worth face to face faculty development program a the we are activity which actually transcends across two weeks will be considered for extra effort because that requires discussion and that is counted towards some more days and it is the four days are also four days of interaction that you have in the safety that is counted towards the total two weak equivalence on a two week equivalent program you will have ten days of face to face your supposed to have ten days of a face to face interaction and classes now this four days will be used for that or what is a count towards that too weak equivalence certificate so unless and until we can we do not schedule these interactions are you will not be eligible for a two week equivalent certificate so in terms of certificate that is the problem number one regarding discussion a second problem i suppose you do the same to your own students saying that okay are you discuss i will you can use the mode lets you create a caution wouldng anew tell to your students that you can use the moodle discussion forum to a a clarify your doubts so you dont need to come to class will they be coming to class at any point of time so yazoos none is what we are seeing the blended program is meant four because this face to face interaction is important you speaking to another person has a lot of value the human element has a lot of value whatever technology we bring in maybe incorporate latest artificial intelligence into ide xbox platform nothing can replace the human element of it cause you learned a lot from your colleagues your peers so that is why we are keeping these are the that is the most important reason that we are keeping these interactions on saturdays and sundays where we know that other one be regular academic activities for many of the participants in the program anda regarding diverse resources four discussion a i think a we are keeping that diverse resources activity for next a view interaction so off you will see all these diverse resources a in the coming days and up one more thing is a as i said earlier not all participants are very active a native of becks discussion across their dips we have always seen that the percentage of active participants summer between forty to sixty percentage of the total enrolled so somebody else looking at and giving you feedback is again it will take some more time for them to get used to the platform get used to the habit of participating in discussion only the queen yeah please wait if you are very useful enough to know who and getting more knowledge in one connecting newcomb new highly on needle having on my my myyahoo nudger thank you so ya so this is one more benefit
